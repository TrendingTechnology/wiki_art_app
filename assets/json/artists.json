He spend most of his childhood in the Danubian port city of Galați, where his father was making and selling candy. Between 1925 and 1927 he studies at an art school in Bucharest, against his father's will. After 2 years, he abandons the Art Academy in 1929 and instead starts working at an architecture bureau. In the same year he briefly contributes to a few Romanian Surrealist revues. \r\n\r\nIn 1930, he moves to France and, thanks to fake ID, changes his name from Herold Blumer (his birth name) to Jacques Hérold. He settles in Paris, where he maintained a close friendship with Constantin Brancusi, for whom he also worked as a chef or even secretary. He also meets Surrealist painter Yves Tanguy, thanks to whom Hérold was allowed in Breton's group, participating at games and contributing with paintings that were held in high esteem by the likes of Raoul Ubac or Breton himself. \r\n\r\nAfter the tensioned period of WWII, he managed to have his first solo exhibition in 1947. Starting with this year's \"Exposition\r\nInternationale du Surréalisme\", he has an active presence in all the important Surrealist exhibitions worldwide. After 1951 (when he also departs from Breton's group), his style increases in abstraction and will be associated later with Lyrical Abstraction and Tachisme. In 1958 he publishes the book \"Maltraité de peinture\" and receives the Copley Foundation prize. In 1959 he has an exhibition at the Tate Gallery from London. In 1972, a monographic exhibition at l'Abbaye de Royaumont. In 1986, one year before his death, he exhibits works at the Venice Biennale.\r\n\r\nDuring his lifetime, Hérold has done cover artwork and illustrations for more than 80 books by the likes of Gherasim Luca, Tristan Tzara, Francis Ponge, Julien Gracq, Marquis de Sade, Michel Butor, Alain Bosquet, Gellu Naum, Ilarie Voronca, Claude Sernet, etc. Art critic Sarane Alexandrian publishes in 1995 the essay book \"Jacques Hérold. Étude historique et critique\".

Raised in the high desert of Arizona, Wheeler began his career as a painter in the early 1960s while studying at the Chouinard Art Institute (now the California Institute of the Arts) in Los Angeles.

In short, [his] medium is not light or new materials or technology, but perception.”\r\n\r\nWork by the artist is held in prominent museum collections, including the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Solomon R.

He was born into a wealthy family of Hebrew intellectuals, which allowed him after graduating high school in his hometown to continue his studies in Baia Mare, Budapest, and at the Academie Grande Chaumière in Paris. He began his career by providing illustrations in the early 1930s for such left-wing magazines as Stânga and Cuvântul liber. In 1932 he had a one-man exhibition in Cluj, and in 1937 he published in Oradea the album Pita de mălai (Corn bread), which includes 12 drawings of the peasant life of Maramureş; these were dramatically detailed, showing the influences of Pieter Bruegel I and of Japanese prints - works that will be exhibited next year to the Contemporary Art Galleries in Paris. In 1944, he was deported to a Nazi concentration camps where he lose parents. Holocaust survivor, from 1950 until 1976 he was a lecturer, then professor at the Department of Graphic Arts of the Institute \"Nicolae Grigorescu\" in Bucharest.\r\n\r\nVasile Kazar brings to his work one of the most authentic testimony about a dramatic destiny assumed lucidly. From the late 1940s until c. 1958 he tried to conform to the aesthetic and ideological precepts of Socialist Realism, but in the early 1960s he reverted to the expressionism that had characterized his work of 1945-7, producing drawings that displayed a dreamlike touch in their scratchy line and biomorph imagery. He developed this style in the 1970s and 1980s in such series of drawings as Apparitions at the Old Court and From my Bestiary. He subsequently evolved a very subtle use of color, which became much harsher. He leaved behind a valuable work that includes cycles of illustrations, such as those for \"Duin elegies. Sonnets to Orpheus\" by Reiner Maria Rilke, \"The Old Court Kings\" by Mateiu Caragiale or for the poems of Catullus, hundreds of drawings which are the pride of private galleries and collections around the world. In 1992 Kazar donated 103 drawings, 7 prints and 6 sketchbooks to the Museum of Art in Bucharest. He left by legacy a small museum in a house of the eighteenth century, with antiques and textiles, in Vadu Izei, Maramureş, which became today a Memorial Museum.

Castillo combine the painting, animation and computer programming to together composed one piece of software art.\nUnlike repetitive video art, these images endlessly evolve in a random progression in which no single composition will ever be precisely repeated; at least, not for hundreds of thousands to trillions of years, depending upon the number of layers in the painting.\nHer explanation: \"I have also integrated natural cycles into these works, such as the moon and the tides, which are represented figuratively in the paintings' imagery, while their animated movement and phases are controlled by real-world, real-time cycles, whose algorithms are programmed into the work\".\nThe reactive pieces make use of Internet connectivity to reflect real-time weather, stock market and live

Boto was born December 27, 1925 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In the Thirties, she and her partner Gregorio Vardanega, an artist of Italian origin, were active participants in the lively artistic atmosphere of the era. The period was typified by forays into various schools and styles, from impressionist to expressionist painting, surrealism to abstraction, all of which led eventually to optical and kinetic art. Having been the first in Argentina to create a work of art that involved movement, Vardanega and Boto chose to move to France in 1959 to further their artistic pursuits.\r\n\r\nDuring this time both artists were constructing Plexiglas works, most often mobiles suspended in space, and Boto would soon play a key role in the evolution of optical and kinetic art. In 1961 she presented her works at the Galerie Denise René in an exhibit entitled Art Abstrait Constructif International. Focussing her work around the concepts of movement, illumination, and color, Boto explored the potential of materials that could modify, absorb, and reflect light, i.e. Plexiglas, aluminum, or stainless steel. In 1964 she approached upon an even more articulated aesthetic utilizing electric mechanisms and projected light on objects in movement. Such is how the first kinetic-light boxes were born.\r\n\r\nMirrors, multiangular surfaces, or reflective metal play a fundamental role in the ability of the artist to distort space and to transform the appearance of each normal object in order to create undefined depth. In the same year, Boto exhibited works at La Maison des Beaux-Arts in Paris and once more at the Galerie Denise René nel 1969. Throughout the course of the Nineties her works were exhibited in France at l’Espace Bateau Lavoir (1993), la Galerie Argentine (1996) and the Saint-Lambert Post Office (1997). Martha Boto died in Paris October 13, 2004. In 2006, the Sicardi Gallery of Houston dedicated an exhibit both to Boto and Gregorio Vardanega, entitled Contact. Le cyber Cosmos de Boto et Vardanega.

Influenced by American action painting and obsessed with developing a language reflecting post-war central Europe, Nonn dedicated the last two decades to working with this somewhat melancholy color combination creating what he terms \"material abstraction.\"\n\nRust plays a major role in these works and as Nonn’s mastery of this unusual painterly medium grows, the works increasingly appear to be the result of corrosion by the elements or the violence of man. As John Laughery suggested in his 1991 article for Art Journal, \"Nonn's imaginative terrain has been blasted and burned like the earth itself, subjected to corrosive defilement: the copper he has applied is oxidizing into green, the rust sweeps over the canvas and wood like sediment left by retreating waters, and its soft tones of orange resemble a radioactive glow as much as the residue of industrial sources.\"\n\nNonn has made his own rust from iron powder that he suspends in an emulsion of industrial acrylic and then oxidizes with various strengths of acids. The textures are built up using rust in combination with sand, or marble dust and occasional but limited use of powdered earth pigments, oxidized copper or weatherworn wood. The resulting \"matter paintings\" record a unique history of the materials that transcend the mere decorative use of pigments to create art that is a contemplation of time and an exploration of nature.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Thomas

Gayfedjian was one of the great masters of Armenian painting in the first half of the 20th-century. He played an extremely important role in the development of Armenian art, having taught several generations of Armenian painters, many of whom later became well-known masters. \nBorn in 1879, Gayfedjian was already a mature man at the turn of the century, and the final years of his life coincided with the beginning of the era of space. His creative activities proceeded along this path - beginning at the end of the 19th-century and ending shortly before his death in 1960 - reflecting a significant part of the complex interlacings of philosophical, aesthetic and ethical views of his time.\nGayfedjian's creative evolution may be divided into three stages. The first, the \"Moscow\" stage consists of two periods: the symbolic period (the 1900's) and the synthetic (1910-1912). The symbolic period of his creative work, from the end of the 19th-century to the beginning of the 20th, led Gayfedjian to make a romantic ideology - to attain catharsis by means of beauty, the cornerstone of his art. This he embodied in his extensive series entitled \"Decorative Motives\" and \"Colour Compositions\". While his \"Decorative Motives\" tended to contain elements of the figurative world, Gayfedjian's abstract \"Colour Compositions\" stand completely on the threshold of new mysteries of 20th-century art, which strived to give figurative shape to the invisible. In works of the synthetic period, Gayfedjian's position in expressing conditional, abstract contemplations is replaced by an inclination towards reality. \nGayfedjian's second creative period, the Akhaltskha period (1912-1923) is when the painter's attitude towards realism developed and became more profound. The tendency of that period was to assimilate abstract poeticism and natural observations with tangible definiteness. The form of his art moves from the synthetic to impressionism, yet Gayfedjian never aimed at cultivating impressionism in its initial form. He transferred the focal point from the \"moment\" category to the \"light\" category, not by applying an analytical approach based on observation and visual means, but as a metaphysical problem. \nThe third, Yerevanian period of Gayfedjian's creations covers the years from 1924 through to the early 1950's. Fulfilling plans set by the Association of Painters of Revolutionary Russia, he was involved until 1934 in preserving his environment. The main theme of the painter's works was Soviet construction in Armenia, but already from the 1920's to 1950's, the lyric landscape began dominating his paintings. It was in landscapes that Gayfedjian succeeded in expressing the essence of a new world feeling and high spiritual mood. Since his purpose was not the visual presentation of reality, but the expression of his personal emotions by means of natural phenomena, Gayfedjian made every effort to free his canvases of visual illusions.\nHowever it may have been expressed, Gayfedjian moved in art from his very first steps, always searching for new, more expressive means of embodying the credo of his life. Points of views were changing, as was the language of art, yet the real essence of that credo remained unchanged. Considering himself a particle of Entity and for that reason capable of the personal joy and sorrow of comprehending the Good and Evil in the world, Gayfedjian lived a life of inner strain. Neither the 20th-century deluge nor the inevitable sufferings, losses, miseries or conflicts of life were able to change or disturb his belief that the world was wonderful, that it had been so from the beginning and would be so forever. \"Erase incidental lines and you will find that the world is beautiful.\" These words of Alexander Block could just as well have belonged to Gayfedjian.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Վահռամ Գայֆեջյան","relatedArtists":["57726dcaedc2cb3880b5058f","57726d84edc2cb3880b48b4f","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f374","57726d93edc2cb3880b4a9ea","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51ebf","57726dfbedc2cb3880b552a2","57726d81edc2cb3880b483ee","57726dc9edc2cb3880b504b9","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f38c","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa47","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a0e8","57726dcfedc2cb3880b50d7f","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4edad","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d713","57726da7edc2cb3880b4ce18","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aaec","57726d93edc2cb3880b4ab01","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e0f9","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4edc5","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d4c7"]},{"id":"57726dccedc2cb3880b5093b","artistName":"Manuel Rivera","url":"manuel-rivera","lastNameFirst":"Rivera Manuel","birthDay":"/Date(-1347321600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(789004800000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 23, 1927","deathDayAsString":"January 2, 1995","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/1a1bcff9-a03c-49d0-8ebf-f7a4d87c75e3.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["5804eadaedc2ce45b4e01a76","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e79","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7208"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Manuel Rivera Hernández","relatedArtists":["57726da0edc2cb3880b4c1c2","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c3be","57726deeedc2cb3880b53ded","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e4ad","57726dc3edc2cb3880b4fbc8","57726dcaedc2cb3880b5063b","57726db9edc2cb3880b4eb45","57726dcaedc2cb3880b50627","57726dceedc2cb3880b50c67","57726dd4edc2cb3880b5161e","57726df6edc2cb3880b54b2e","57726de3edc2cb3880b52de7","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4c10c","57726dd3edc2cb3880b51369","57726de0edc2cb3880b5290b","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bd43","57726dc6edc2cb3880b5001a","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f301","57726db2edc2cb3880b4dff9","57726dcaedc2cb3880b506df"]},{"id":"57726dcdedc2cb3880b50a3d","artistName":"Alex Hay","url":"alex-hay","lastNameFirst":"Hay Alex","birthDay":"/Date(-1262304000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1930","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/12ac6e8d-05df-44b7-ae62-fc7c045ad85a.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f69","57726a67edc2ca38801d4f31"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Alex Hay","relatedArtists":["57726dd0edc2cb3880b50f90","57726db8edc2cb3880b4e944","57726da8edc2cb3880b4cf7d","57726d87edc2cb3880b4935e","57726dd1edc2cb3880b510da","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c377","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c34c","57726db8edc2cb3880b4e9d2","57726df1edc2cb3880b54336","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f4b4","57726dc4edc2cb3880b4fd2b","57726db0edc2cb3880b4db68","57726dd6edc2cb3880b518e7","57726da7edc2cb3880b4ce5e","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e5b8","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c878","57726dccedc2cb3880b50970","57726ddeedc2cb3880b525f9","57726de1edc2cb3880b52afb","57726de1edc2cb3880b52bad"]},{"id":"57726dc0edc2cb3880b4f623","artistName":"Ding Yanyong","url":"ding-yanyong","lastNameFirst":"Yanyong Ding","birthDay":"/Date(-2145916800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(252460800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1902","deathDayAsString":"1978","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/ca291341-ba44-4b65-9ea7-7997c7dc0fb6.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad7290","57726a68edc2ca38801d5091"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Ding Yanyong","relatedArtists":["57726dc0edc2cb3880b4f5e3","57726dafedc2cb3880b4dade","57726dc0edc2cb3880b4f64e","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ec81","57726dc0edc2cb3880b4f639","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4bf46","57726daeedc2cb3880b4d933"]},{"id":"57726da5edc2cb3880b4c9b7","artistName":"Sandro Chia","url":"sandro-chia","lastNameFirst":"Chia Sandro","birthDay":"/Date(-747964800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 20, 1946","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/7ed9318d-4a97-4dba-bb2b-188bc6c1467d.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Chia","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d0","57726a68edc2ca38801d4fd9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Sandro Chia is an Italian painter and sculptor.

Maleas  was one of the most important Post-impressionist Greek painters of the 20th century. Along with Konstantinos Parthenis, he is considered the most important Modern Artist in Greece.\r\n\r\nMaleas was born and grew up in Istanbul, far away from the Greek artistic centre in Athens. The young painter avoided therefore the influence of the Munich School that dominated Athenian Art. He studied at the Phanar Greek Orthodox College and then left for Paris in 1901 at an age of 23 years old to study initially architecture. In Paris he eventually decided to study painting until 1908 near Henri Martin. In 1913 he returned to Greece, initially in Thessaloniki and then based in Athens. In 1917 he became a member of the avant-guard Art Group (Ομάδας Τέχνης), that imported the international contemporary art movements to Greece. He travelled extensively in Greece, Western Europe, Palestine and Egypt where he drew some of the subjects for his famous landscapes. Apart from painting, he was also involved in the public discussion on the modernisation of the Greek language. He was a friend of Glenos, Delmouzos and Triantafylidis. He has illustrated the first alphabet book in the new modern Greek language Demotiki (Αλφαβητάρι με τον ήλιο). He has written articles to the newspapers Nouma, Elefthero Vima and in many art journals. Maleas has been recognised for his artistic contribution from the Greek Government which awarded him with the Highest Acknowledgement of Letters and Arts.\r\n\r\nMaleas work has been influenced by the work of Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and from the art movements of symbolism, impressionism and fauvism. His paintings are characterised by the very light and bright colours, the large brushes that revolutionalised the stagnant Athenian art of the time. Most art critics have condemned his work and it was only Fotos Politis that recognised the value of Maleas work and urged the young artists to learn from Maleas paintings. Maleas is still one of the most popular Greek modern artists and his works are exhibited at the National Gallery of Athens and elsewhere.

He was born in Vienna in 1905, as the first of four sons of the Austrian-Jewish merchant and inventor Gustav Robert Paalen, and his German wife, the actress Clothilde Emilie Gunkel. The first years of his life he spent between Vienna and Styria where his father had a fashionable health resort. 1912 the family moved to Berlin and to the Silesian city of Żagań, where his father had bought a castle, the St. Rochusburg. Wolfgang Paalen went to different schools in Sagan, before his parents engaged a private teacher.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, the family moved to Rome, where the Paalens received many guests, such as Leo von König who became Wolfgang's first teacher. In 1924, he went back to Berlin where he applied for the Academy without success. In 1925, he exhibited in the Berliner Sezession and went through a further formation in aesthetics, deeply influenced by Julius Meier-Graefe, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and the Gestalt theory of Max Wertheimer. After another year of studies in Paris and Cassis (1925/26) where he met Jean (Janco) Varda and Georges Braque, he visited the art school of Hans Hofmann in Munich and Saint Tropez until 1928.\r\n\r\nAfter 1928, he stayed again in Cassis and Paris, studied shortly with Fernand Léger and became a member of the group Abstraction-Creation in 1933 and the Parisian Surrealists around André Breton in 1936, participating in all its major exhibitions and outreach thereafter, until he travelled to New York in May 1939. The same year he traveled through British Columbia with his wife, the French painter Alice Rahon and his friend Eva Sulzer. In autumn 1939 he followed an invitation of Frida Kahlo and settled in Mexico, where together with the Peruvian poet César Moro he curated the International Surrealist Exhibition in the Galería de Arte Mexicano. During the war years Paalen retreated more and more to his studio in San Angel, newly built by the German architect Max Cetto.\r\n\r\nDue to his magazine, his presence and exhibitions in New York City, 1940 Julien Levy, 1945 Peggy Guggenheim Art of this Century and 1946 Galerie Nierendorf, he influenced significantly the genesis of Abstract Expressionism. 1949 he worked in San Francisco with Gordon Onslow Ford and Lee Mullican in the Dynaton group, before he went to Paris in 1952 and back again to Mexico in 1954. He committed suicide in 1959 in Taxco, Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his association with the Surrealists and their attempts to transform automatic writing into drawing and painting, he created fumage – a technique for generating evocative patterns with the smoke and soot of a lit candle. Between 1936 and 1937 Paalen developed with these visionary-ephemeral forms on canvas, which he then mostly painted over in oil, a number of mature paintings which soon made his international reputation. Together with Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray and Salvador Dalí he was among the responsibles for the design of the International Exhibition of Surrealism in the Palais des Beaux Arts in Paris 1938, where he installed one of the first environments beneath Duchamps ceiling of empty sacks of coal. It was particularly in the forties and fifties that Paalen's art played a major role in changing the conception of abstract art.

He lives in Paris. He has spent his professional career working and teaching between both Paris and Caracas. His work is represented in museums and public art sites internationally. He is represented by two American galleries: Sicardi Gallery in Houston, Texas, and Moka Gallery in Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nIn 1957, he returned to Venezuela and worked at his studio, Estudio de Artes Visuales, and started investigating the role of color in kinetic art. He also worked as a graphic designer for the Education Ministry publications, Caracas. During 1958-1960, he served as the Assistant Director and Professor at the Caracas School of Fine Arts.  In 1965, Cruz-Diez the Centre culturel Noroit, Arras, France, as a graphic designer. During 1972-73, he taught Kinetic Techniques at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris and Universite d'Enseignement et de Recherches. From 1986 to 1993, he was the Titular Professor and Director of the Art Unit of the Institute of Advanced Studies (IDEA), Caracas.\r\n\r\nDuring Cruz-Diez's time in school, he studied the work of Georges Seurat and Josef Albers, both artists who experimented with color relationships, aesthetics and perception. While in Europe, he was not only influenced by the Art Movements, he also was influenced by the European surrounding, particularly the plant life, which differed so much from the plant life in his native Venezuela. Cruz-Diez is often associated with two Venezuelan Kinetic Artists, Jesus Soto and Alejandro Otero. All three artists share aesthetic similarities in structure and form, and are considered to have secured Venezuela’s position in the international art world. Although Cruz-Diez arrived in Paris ten years after Soto, their national and artistic connections are apparent.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cruz-Diez's career was spent between Caracas and Paris, the political unrest and development in Venezuela directly affected his career. Venezuela existed under dictatorship for decades, with Juan Vincente Gomez from 1908 until his death in 1935. His rule influenced the academic art institutions, with little room for growth of the Venezuelan avant-garde. His successor, Eleazar Lopez Contreras changed the artistic climate by supporting study of artists such as Cezanne and other European Modernist painters. After World War II several Venezuelan artists were able to study abroad, often in Paris. The new challenges faced by the development of modernity presented a receptive audience for Cruz-Diez, which allowed for a break in the traditional artists of Venezuela.The new cultural climate, which was receptive to the Kinetic Artist, was directly linked to the new technological advancements represented by the Kinetic artists. Cruz-Diez’s Op Art became popular with the political elite, often because the art lacked any political message.\r\n\r\nThroughout his career Cruz-Diez has focused on four types of self-defined op art Categories: Physichoromies, Choromointerferences, Chromosaturations, and Transchromies.

He spent his childhood in German occupied Belgium. From the age of 14, Gustave Singier starts to paint. He follows courses at the Boulle School for 3 years, then he works as a designer of interior architecture and furniture until 1936. He designs and paints at the same time as he works. Singier meets the painter Charles Walch who encourages him and reveals to him the liberty of pictorial expression, natably that which concerns color. He participates in numerous Parisian Salons from 1936 - Salon des Independants, Salon d’Automne, Salon des Tuileries, etc. He becomes friends with Alfred Manessier and Le Moal whose research suits his own spirit. From this period, his pictorial evolution intertwines with that of Manessier, depending on one or the other’s need to find an objective support in variations of abstract colors or, on the contrary, make an effort a more complete liberation. Elevated by a poetic sensation, there is in this art a new impressionism that is similar to cubist qcquisitions. In 1941, Singier joins to a group of young artists that show their work in the exhibition ‘Vingt Peintres de tradtion francaise’ (Twenty Painters of the French Tradition) at the Braun Gallery, an exhibition that will defy the occupied Army. In 1945 he is one of the founding members of the Salon de Mai. As with other painters of his generation, Singier discovers Kandinsky, Klee, Mondrian; this new path, is the determining factor in liberating Singier from pictorial form. The work of Singier will separate itself from Manessier, as he finds his own personal qualities. Resorting to tachiste techniques, his art becomes more fluid, thanks to the effects of watercolor. This is where the artist excels. The work of Gustave Singier expands in diverse ways: from mural painting, tapestry, stain glass, mosaics, costumes and theatre set design, burin engraving, lithographs, to illustrated works. Gustave Singier will teach in Paris, at the Ranson Academy from 1951-1954, then at the School of Fine Arts from 1967-1978.

She lived and worked primarily in Washington, D.C. and the Washington Post described her as a force in the Washington Color School.\r\n\r\nAlma Thomas' early work was representational in manner, and then and upon classes at Howard and training under James V. Herring and Lois Mailou Jones her work became more abstract. Thomas would not be recognized as a professional artist until her retirement from teaching in 1960, when she enrolled in classes at American University. There she learned about the Color Field movement and theory from Joe Summerford and Jacob Kainen and became interested in the use of color and composition. Within twelve years after her first class at American she began creating Color Field paintings, inspired by the work of the New York School and Abstract Expressionism. She worked out of the kitchen in her house, creating works like Watusi (Hard Edge) (1963), a manipulation of the Matisse cutout The Snail, in which Thomas shifted shapes around and changed the colors that Matisse used, and named it after a Chubby Checker song.\r\n\r\nHer first retrospective exhibit was in 1966 at the Gallery of Art at Howard University, curated by art historian James A. Porter. For this exhibition she created Earth Paintings, a series of nature inspired abstract works, including Wind and Crepe Myrtle Concerto (1973) which art historian Sharon Patton considers \"one of the most Minimalist Color-Field paintings ever produced by an African-American artist.\" These paintings have been compared to Byzantine mosaics and the pointillist paintings of Georges-Pierre Seurat. A friend of Delilah Pierce, Thomas and Pierce would drive into the countryside where Thomas would seek inspiration, pulling ideas from the effects of light and atmosphere on rural environments. Thomas was, in 1972, the first African-American woman to have a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and within the same year an exhibition was also held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art.

From 1937 onwards he was a prime mover behind the Allianz group of Swiss artists. Bill is widely considered the single most decisive influence on Swiss graphic design beginning in the 1950s with his theoretical writing and progressive work. His connection to the days of the Modern Movement gave him special authority. As an industrial designer, his work is characterized by a clarity of design and precise proportions. As a designer and artist, Bill sought to create forms which visually represent the New Physics of the early 20th century. He sought to create objects so that the new science of form could be understood by the senses: that is as a concrete art. Thus Bill is not a rationalist -as is typically thought- but rather a phenomenologist. One who understands embodiment as the ultimate expression of a concrete art. In this way he is not some much extending as re-interpreting Bauhaus theory. Yet curiously Bill's critical interpreters have not really grasped this fundamental issue.\r\n\r\nIn 1944, Bill became a professor at the school of arts in Zurich. He co-founded in 1953 the Ulm School of Design. Bill was a professor at the Staatliche Hochschule für Bildende Künste Hamburg and chair of Environmental Design from 1967 to 1974. In 1973 he became an associate member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Science, Literature and Fine Art in Brussels. In 1976 he became a member of the Berlin Academy of Arts. In addition to his teaching, Bill wrote and lectured extensively on art, architecture and design, appearing at symposiums and design conferences around the world. In particular, he wrote books about Le Corbusier, Kandinsky, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and artistic theory.\r\n\r\nHis 1951 retrospective at the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art was highly influential, helping the birth of a Brazilian avant-garde that would eventually move from concretism to a looser, more creative form - neo-concretism.\r\n\r\nBill died en route to a hospital after collapsing from a heart attack at Berlin Tegel Airport. He was 85 and lived in Zumikon, a Zürich suburb.

She was married to James Truitt in 1948 (they divorced in 1969), and she became a full-time artist in the 1950s. She made what is considered her most important work in the early 1960s anticipating in many respects the work of minimalists like Donald Judd and Ellsworth Kelly. However, she was unlike minimalists in some significant ways.\r\n\r\nTruitt's first wood sculpture, titled \"First\" (1961), consists of three white vertical slates rooted in a block ground, each coming to a point and braced to each other at the rear, resembling a fragment of a picket fence.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture that made her significant to the development of Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, for instance, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color. Her first solo exhibition was in 1963 at the André Emmerich gallery, and in many senses her work also hews to what was emerging there. She was one of only three women included in the influential 1966 exhibition, Primary Structures at the Jewish Museum in New York. In Washington her work was represented by Pyramid Gallery which later became the Osuna Gallery.\r\n\r\nTruitt is also known for three books she wrote, Daybook, Turn, and Prospect, all journals. For many years she was associated with the University of Maryland, College Park, where she was a professor, and the artists' colony Yaddo, where she served as interim president.\r\n\r\nThe Estate of Anne Truitt is represented by Matthew Marks Gallery in New York and Stephen Friedman Gallery in London.

She earned a graduate degree from Cooper Union in New York City, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Yale University. She studied art history at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University.\r\n\r\nFlack's early work was abstract; one such painting paid tribute to Franz Kline. The ironic kitsch themes in her early work influenced Jeff Koons. But gradually, Flack became a New Realist and finally a photorealist.\r\n\r\nThe critic Graham Thompson wrote,\r\n\r\n\"One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism, radical realism, or hyper-realism and painters like Richard Estes, Chuck Close, and Audrey Flack as well, often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs.\"\r\n\r\nArt critic Robert C. Morgan writes in The Brooklyn Rail about Flack's 2010 exhibition at Gary Snyder Project Space, Audrey Flack Paints a Picture, \"She has taken the signs of indulgence, beauty, and excess and transformed them into deeply moving symbols of desire, futility, and emancipation.\r\n\r\nFlack has claimed to have found the photorealist movement too restricting, and, in her later years, gains much of her inspiration from baroque art.\r\n\r\nA pioneer of Photorealism and a nationally recognized painter and sculptor, Flack is represented by Gary Snyder Gallery. Her work is held in the collections of major museums around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the National Museum of Art in Canberra, Australia. She was the first photorealist painter to have work purchased by the Museum of Modern Art.\r\n\r\nShe was awarded the St. Gaudens Medal from Cooper Union, and the honorary Albert Dome professorship from Bridgeport University. She is an honorary professor at George Washington University, and is currently a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAudrey Flack has taught and lectured extensively both nationally, and internationally. She wrote Art and Soul (1986), a book expressing some of her thoughts on being an artist. Audrey Flack lives and works in New York City and Long Island.

While working in the Color Field he was strict to adhering to an abstract style inspired by Minimalism until he learned about decorative imagery. He kept the same color schemes and structures, but incorporated floral motif and a more painterly style. Zakanitch was exhibiting in New York as early as 1968. In 1975 he met Miriam Schapiro while he served as a guest instructor at the University of California, San Diego. A year later, in New York, the two artists would organize an organization around Pattern & Decoration artists.

In 1922, Michonze moved to Paris and met Max Ernst who later introduced him to the Surrealists, notably André Breton, Paul Éluard, Yves Tanguy and André Masson. He furthered his art studies by taking classes at the École des Beaux-Arts. During this period, Michonze met and developed a strong friendship with the Jewish École de Paris artist Chaim Soutine. Between the period 1934-1936, Michonze exhibited at the Salon des Surindépendants. He described his work at these exhibitions as \"Surreal naturalism\". Michonze fought in the war and, after 1943, settled into a studio on Paris's Rue de Seine. He took up French citizenship in 1947, and in 1949, the French Fund for Modern Art acquired his now seminal canvas La moisson (The Harvest).\r\n\r\nFrom 1954-1977, Michonze continued and perfected his life's work. He had extended stays in the United States where he spent time with his close friend, the American author Henry Miller. Michonze also travelled frequently to Israel where he exhibited, visited with his mother, and re-acquainted himself with his Jewish roots. He died of a heart attack in his studio at rue de Seine in Paris on December 29, 1982.\r\n\r\nMichonze is primarily known as a landscape and figurative artist. A marked majority of his paintings include depictions of groups of people - families, villagers, peasants, children - and most works evince an allegory or narrative of some kind. Each work is imbued with mystery, a sort of hidden dialogue that enhances the appeal of the work and piques the viewer's curiosity. In a 1959 letter to the British art critic Peter Stone, Michonze wrote of his work: \"My subjects have no subject. They exist only for a poetic end. If the poetry is there, the canvas is complete. No histories. Only pure poetry, preferably untitled.\" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Grigore Michonznic","relatedArtists":["57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bdb3","57726dd2edc2cb3880b51278","57726dd6edc2cb3880b51945","57726dfdedc2cb3880b55489","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c4ce","57726d87edc2cb3880b49265","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d4ef","57726df8edc2cb3880b54e07","57726dd9edc2cb3880b51e68","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a3c3","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4ba70","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f2e9","57726dededc2cb3880b53d65","57726deeedc2cb3880b53e1e","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f2d1","57726d7cedc2cb3880b47b8c","57726d7bedc2cb3880b479df","57726d9bedc2cb3880b4b7fa","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d532","57726dededc2cb3880b53da2"]},{"id":"57726da6edc2cb3880b4cc0e","artistName":"Pat Lipsky","url":"pat-lipsky","lastNameFirst":"Lipsky Pat","birthDay":"/Date(-915148800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1941","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/74591882-a87d-405b-a374-6b41314decba.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Lipsky","dictionaries":["5804eadaedc2ce45b4e01a76","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e69","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4eb9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Pat Lipsky is an American painter associated with Lyrical Abstraction, Color Field Painting, and Geometric abstraction. Lipsky grew up in New York City. She graduated with a BFA from Cornell University in 1963, receiving an MFA from the Graduate Program in Painting at Manhattan's Hunter College, where she studied with the painter and sculptor Tony Smith.\r\n\r\nRaised by a painter mother and an engineer father, Lipsky had her first one-woman show in New York, at the André Emmerich Gallery. Her work at the time was strongly in the mode of “Lyrical Abstraction.\" The 1969 canvas \"Spiked Red\" (Collection of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Bienstock, New York) demonstrates Lipsky's then-approach: close hues, bright color waves and bursts. In The New York Times, the critic Hilton Kramer found that the painter's work looked both to the aesthetic past and future: \"Miss Lipsky reintroduces the drip, splatter and smear of abstract expressionism for notable anti-expressionist purposes...She also demonstrates a very clear identity of her own. Her pictures are very handsome, and it will be interesting to see how she develops what is already a bold pictorial intelligence.\" Lipsky was invited to participate in the influential 1970-1971 Lyrical Abstraction exhibition which traveled the country and culminated at New York's Whitney Museum; the critic Noel Frackman highlighted her contributions for freshness, gesture and exuberance, finding the style \"sustained a mood which celebrates the sheer splendor of color. The edges of these shapes lick out like flames and there is an incendiary vividness in the impetuous yet directed forms...These are mouth-watering paintings.\"\r\n\r\nBy the later seventies and eighties, Lipsky had expanded her palette to include bolder colors and geometric forms. She had also begun to explore, as the critic Katherine Crum later wrote, a pictorial vocabulary in direct challenge to her roots in lyrical abstraction. By 2003, the critic Karen Wilkin would declare Lipsky in The New Criterion to be an \"unrepentant abstract painter.\" Wilkin found in the work, \"A lifetime's accumulated experience of all kinds, including the experience of looking at art. That, of course, is what all art worth taking seriously—whether abstract, figurative, or somewhere in between—is supposed to address.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Lipsky continued to refine her broader color concerns, achieving a brooding, more sharply-defined palette. A selection of works from this period, \"The Black Paintings,\" was exhibited in Miami in 1994 and New York City in 1997. Wilkin found the \"deliberately limited\" dark work of this period to be \"dramatic\" and \"powerful.\" In the 2000s, Lipsky began another redefinition of palette, reincorporating color within a bold central image.

Though he was a Social realist in his early career, he is best known as a New realist. Beef is a common element in his work.\r\n\r\nBorn in Tunuyán, where he lived until age seven, he later moved with his family to Mendoza. At the age of fourteen, he entered the Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes where he studied under Sergio Sergi in drawing and engraving, Lorenzo Dominguez in sculpture, and Bernareggi Francisco and Ramón Gomez Cornet in painting. At the National University of Cuyo, he studied with Lino Enea Spilimbergo.\r\n\r\nAlonso received his first award in 1947. In 1951, he won first prize at the Salon of Painting in San Rafael, the North Hall in Santiago del Estero, and drawing at the Salon del Norte Tucumán. In 1953, Alonso exhibited at the Gallery Viau of Buenos Aires, then traveled to Europe where he exhibited in Paris and Madrid. In 1957, he won the competition held by Emecé Editores to illustrate the second part of Don Quixote, and Martín Fierro in 1959. In 1961, he won the Premio Chantal del Salón de Acuarelistas y Grabadores of Buenos Aires. In the same year, while visiting London, he discovered acrylic painting techniques. His Don Quixote pictures were published on postcards in the Soviet Union in 1963.\r\n\r\nHis work, characterized by expressive power and social commitment, has been exhibited in numerous exhibitions, including at the Art Gallery International (Buenos Aires), where, in 1967, some 250 of his works relating to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy were exhibited. Other exhibitions included the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, as well as tapestries and collages at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana in Cuba. In 1971, his works were exhibited in European galleries such as Villa Giulia in Rome, the Eidos of Milan, and the Bedford in London. In 2005, 400 years after Cervantes' work was published, the Museum of Design and Illustration held a tribute exhibition at Buenos Aires' Museo de Artes Plásticas Eduardo Sívori where Alonso's prints and original drawings were displayed. His illustrations have been included in the novel Mad Toy by Roberto Arlt.\r\n\r\nAlonso married the artist Ivonne Fauvety. Following the coup of 1976, and the disappearance of his daughter Paloma (born 25 July 1956) the following year, Alonso went into exile in Italy, and in 1979, he moved to Madrid. He returned to Argentina two years later. The Bienal de Pintura Paloma Alonso. named in her honor, is a 1990 joint initiative of Alonso and Teresa Nachman.\r\n\r\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alonso (last visited on Oct. 2013)

When a student he entered a youth group fighting against sultan's government, because of it he had been subjected to the persecution all lifelong. His role in liberation movement that had been carried in Western Armenia is important.\r\nHe continued education and majored in fine arts. He finished an art society school in Saint-Petersburg (1895—1897), then in 1899-1904 he studied at Académie Julian, a private art school in Paris.\r\nTerlemezian also befriended, painted, and roomed with Komitas Vardapet during Komitas's years in the Ottoman Empire.\r\nIn 1909, Panos Terlemezian was elected as a mayor of Van. In 1915 he had been elected a so-called “member of temporary military government”, having direct participation in Van battles for self-defence and became one of the leaders of Van Resistance.\r\nAfter the Armenian Genocide he lived in France, Italy, Spain, and USA. In 1928, after the Sovetization of Armenia, he moved to Yerevan, where he lived until his death in 1941. Influenced by impressionism, he became the author of industrial pictures (1929–31, National Gallery of Armenia).\r\nThe contribution of Panos Terlemezyan in Armenian fine arts is invaluable.

He is best known for his watercolor paintings of the architectural monuments of the medieval Armenian city of Ani, and for designing the currency and postage stamps of the first Republic of Armenia (1918–1920). As a result of over 20 years devoted to art, Fetvadjian produced no less than 2,000 works, varying from lucid pencil drawings to painstakingly accurate watercolors, that depicted historically significant churches, monasteries, chapels and palaces. A considerable number of his other works were also portraits of Armenians at the turn of the 20th century.\r\nFetvadjian was born in Trebizond in 1866, in the then Ottoman Empire. He attended a national art institute in the city of his birth and continued his studies at the State Fine Arts School (Imperial Academy of Art) in the capital at Constantinople, which had only been recently opened by an Armenian sculptor named Yervand Voskan. Fetvadjian graduated from the academy in 1887 and pursued higher learning abroad: he left for Rome and was admitted to the San Luca Art Academy, where he studied under the wing of Italian painter and sculptor Cesare Maccari.\r\nFetvadjian's artistic talents were brought into the public spotlight when he participated in the Italian national art exhibition in 1891. His studies would later take him to Vienna (1891–1895) and later Saint Petersburg. In Russia, he participated in art exhibitions and joined the Russian Artists' Society. Throughout the early 20th century, he continued to hold exhibitions, and his artwork was seen on displays at the Louvre (1919, 1920) and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\r\n\r\n","gender":"male","originalArtistName":" Ֆեթվաճյան Արշակ Աբրահամի ","relatedArtists":["57726db7edc2cb3880b4e6c8","59679747edc2cb73d8da5822","57726d88edc2cb3880b494cd","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a43b","59ce7095edc2c908e8135d80","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dc30","57726e05edc2cb3880b562bb","57726d95edc2cb3880b4ada3","57726de3edc2cb3880b52d5c","57726e05edc2cb3880b56291","57726db9edc2cb3880b4ea89","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e58c","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4c0ea","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b5ea","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e5e4","57726db4edc2cb3880b4e23a","57726e05edc2cb3880b56345","57726d83edc2cb3880b487e0","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d3c3","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b58a"]},{"id":"57726e06edc2cb3880b5638b","artistName":"Hovsep Pushman","url":"hovsep-pushman","lastNameFirst":"Hovsep Pushmanian","birthDay":"/Date(-2923689600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-122515200000)/","birthDayAsString":"May 9, 1877","deathDayAsString":"February 13, 1966","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/a0ce5507-4a5a-4bed-9439-966809fc188d.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hovsep_Pushman","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7220","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f20","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Hovsep Pushman was an American artist of Armenian background. He was known for his contemplative still lifes and sensitive portraits of women, often in exotic dress. He was most closely associated during his lifetime with the Grand Central Art Galleries, which represented him from its opening in 1922 until his death in 1966.\r\nHovsep Pushman was born and grew up in the town of Dikranagerd in Asia Minor, where his family, originally \"Pushmanian,\" was in the carpet business. Pushman showed artistic ability early, and at age 11 was the youngest student ever admitted to Istanbul's Imperial School of Fine Arts.\r\nIn 1896, Pushman's family emigrated to Chicago, where he studied Chinese culture, immersing himself in Asian art, and began to teach at the age of 17. He then moved to Paris and studied at the Académie Julian under Jules Joseph Lefebvre, Tony Robert-Fleury and Adolphe Déchenaud. Pushman exhibited his work at the Salon des Artistes Français, where he won medals in 1914 and 1921. Pushman returned to the United States in 1914, and in 1916 moved to Riverside, California, living at the city's Mission Inn until 1919. There he accepted some portrait commissions, including one that still hangs at the inn. In 1918 Pushman and a group of California painters founded the Laguna Beach Art Association; the same year he was awarded the California Art Club's Ackerman Prize.\r\nAfter his time in California Pushman spent several years in Paris.\r\nIn 1932, Pushman was honored with a one-man show at the Galleries. Sixteen paintings were on display and all sold the opening day. The prices ranged from $3,500 up to $10,000 (the equivalent of more than $150,000 in 2009). The same year his painting \"The Daughter of the Sheykh,\" which had won a silver medal in Paris in 1921, was purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The winner of the 1936 art drawing at the Grand Central Art Galleries, Walter S. Gifford of AT&T, selected a Pushman still life of a Chinese statuette.\r\nIn 1958 the Grand Central Art Galleries, which had been Pushman's home since they opened in 1923, were forced out of the Grand Central Terminal. Eighty-one-year-old Pushman was present at the final reception at the Galleries' Terminal location, which was attended by more than 400 people.\r\nPushman died on February 13, 1966, in New York City. Three months later, Hulia Shaljian Pushman, his widow, followed him.\r\n","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Հովսեփ Փուշման","relatedArtists":["57726db9edc2cb3880b4eaa1","57726d83edc2cb3880b48a13","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa47","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ac6c","57726d89edc2cb3880b4965f","57726d7eedc2cb3880b47f72","57726dfeedc2cb3880b556ec","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a5ee","57726e05edc2cb3880b561ee","57726d85edc2cb3880b48cef","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a21d","57726e02edc2cb3880b55e4a","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4ee55","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e089","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e532","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a4fa","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a3db","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a423","57726db1edc2cb3880b4dd28","5a9b426bedc2c968080a7c9e"]},{"id":"57726e06edc2cb3880b564f9","artistName":"Edgar Chahine","url":"edgar-chahine","lastNameFirst":"Chahine Edgar","birthDay":"/Date(-3003264000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-719280000000)/","birthDayAsString":"October 31, 1874","deathDayAsString":"March 18, 1947","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/d5eb596f-a2fa-4ed8-ada3-78ed70615702.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Chahine","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7220","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e70","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d31"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Edgar Chahine was born in Vienna but moved to Constantinople at a very young age. There he began his studies under the financial support of his father who was the director of the Ottoman Bank. His artistic abilities were soon noticed by his professor, Melkon Tiratzuyan, who advised him to pursue his studies in Italy in order to participate in a more active artistic environment. He then moved to Venice, Italy where he attended the prestigious Armenian Lyceum Mourad Rafealian on the San Lazzaro Island. He studied under Antonio Ermolao Paoletti at the renowned Academia di Belle Arti. After gaining much experience in Italy, he then moved to Paris in 1895. He enrolled at the Académie Julian, and had successful exhibitions at the Society of French Artists. His first painting which was exhibited at the Paris Salon “Societe Des Artist Francais” in 1896, was a portrait of a beggar. He continued to have exhibitions from 1896 to 1899. In these exhibitions, Chahine included his art series called \"Lamentable Life\" which features the tables of poor people. In 1900, his prints earned him a gold medal at the Universal Exhibition in Paris. In 1903, he won another gold medal at the Venice Biennale. Chahine often turned to Armenian themes and in 1926 was a founding member of “Ani”, the Union of French-Armenian Artists of Paris. He became a naturalized French citizen in 1925 and was awarded the Légion d'Honneur in 1932. Unfortunately, Edgar Chahine's artistic career took an unexpected turn when many of his prints were lost in a fire in his atelier in 1926, and many more were destroyed in a flood in 1942. Due to these unfortunate events, much of his paintings and prints are yet to be seen or discovered.\r\nIn 1928, Edgar Chahine became very popular in France. By the end of that year, a museum in Crouttes–Vimoutiers in the Orne region of France was named after him, Musée Chahine.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Էդգար Շահին","relatedArtists":["57726dbbedc2cb3880b4ee0d","57726dc5edc2cb3880b4fd57","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a5b8","57726d89edc2cb3880b496c3","57726d9bedc2cb3880b4b86c","57726dbcedc2cb3880b4f047","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cd69","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e0f9","57726d93edc2cb3880b4ab01","59919181edc2c96e74cbb7e0","57726da7edc2cb3880b4ce18","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d713","57726dc8edc2cb3880b50274","57726dcfedc2cb3880b50d7f","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa47","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cda2","57726d91edc2cb3880b4a7a2","57726e02edc2cb3880b55de0","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa76","57726dfbedc2cb3880b552a2"]},{"id":"57726e06edc2cb3880b5652b","artistName":"Haroutiun Galentz","url":"haroutiun-galentz","lastNameFirst":"Haroutiun Kharmandaian Galentz (Galentz)","birthDay":"/Date(-1884902400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-83808000000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 10, 1910","deathDayAsString":"May 7, 1967","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/09f7d22d-50a7-40ac-b1a8-8524984a6670.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haroutiun_Galentz","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7220","57726a68edc2ca38801d4fc1","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d71","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e58"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Galentz was born in Gürün, Ottoman Empire (present day Turkey) on March 27 of 1910. His father Tiratur owned a wool-dying factory which left a profound impression on young Galentz with its vats of bright colors. In 1915, during the Armenian genocide, Galentz’ father was taken away by Turkish soldiers, never to be seen again. Galentz along with his three brothers and mother escaped to Aleppo, Syria. A few days after their arduous trek into Aleppo, Galentz’ mother died of starvation and fatigue. Galentz and his three brothers spent their childhood and youth in an Aleppo orphanage. Despite the hardships of life in the orphanage, Galentz began cultivating his passion for arts in part by encouragement from one of the orphanage sisters. He often escaped the orphanage to roam around the Aleppo markets and paint. French art historians called him \"The man who had no childhood\".\r\nIn 1922, at the age of 12, Galentz left the orphanage to become an apprentice to a lithographer and later received his primary artistic education from Onik Avetisyan in Aleppo. He then followed his brothers to Tripoli, Lebanon where they had opened a photo studio. Galentz painted backgrounds to be used in the photo sessions. From 1929-1933, French painter Claude Michulet was his teacher in Beirut Academy of Fine Arts, where he then taught painting until 1939.\r\nGalentz was awarded the Medal of Merit by the presidium of International Exhibitions in New York in 1939, and the honorary prize by the government of Lebanon for his bas-reliefs in the Pavilion of Lebanon presented at the New York International exhibition.\r\nIn 1938 he took into apprenticeship a young woman by the name of Armine Paronyan (Galentz), whom he later married on May 2, 1943. Armine became a prominent Armenian painter alongside her husband. They had two sons, Armen and Saro (b. 1946), who is a painter too.\r\nGalentz and family expatriated to Yerevan, Armenia in June 1946. The next year he participated in a group show organized to exhibit the works of newly expatriated painters. He participated in group exhibitions organized by the Artists Union, of which he was a member since 1947. He held several solo shows both in Yerevan and in Moscow and was posthumously awarded Armenian Republic’s (SSR) State Prize in 1967.\r\nHis landscapes and still lifes are imbued with light. According to Henrik Igityan, \"looking at the radiant, cheerful paintings of Galents, remembering his kind uistful eyes, one finds it impossible to realize that this quiet sad man is the author of those bright optimistic poetic tales\".\r\nAlexander Gitovich dedicated one of his poems to Galentz. Galentz is one of the heroes of \"People without childhood\" by Antranig Dzarugian.\r\nGalentz’ house in Yerevan is now a museum. His paintings are also in the collections of National Gallery of Armenia (Yerevan), Yerevan Modern Art Museum, Republic of Armenia’s Cultural Ministry as well as private collections in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Tbilisi, New York, Paris, Vienna, Beirut, Aleppo, Cambridge, San Francisco, Los Angeles to list a few.\r\nOn April 27, 2010 Haroutiun and Armine Galentz museum was opened in Yerevan, Galents Str. 18. There are 200 canvases and more than 200 graphical works in the museum, including archive materials. The museum has two floors. Harutyun Galents’s works are displayed on the first floor.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Հարություն Կալենց","relatedArtists":["57726dbcedc2cb3880b4ef97","57726dd2edc2cb3880b51230","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51efe","587f2802edc2c9c5106601e1","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ac84","57726dcbedc2cb3880b5080a","57726db2edc2cb3880b4df81","57726dd5edc2cb3880b51735","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a8f8","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a829","57726dc4edc2cb3880b4fd3f","5a35ca02edc2c90f18f65a76","57726d87edc2cb3880b49407","57726debedc2cb3880b53916","57726decedc2cb3880b53c01","592e4177edc2c97bc8fa78c8","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e6de","57726ddbedc2cb3880b520bb","592cee2aedc2c92a04d66dec","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ebd3"]},{"id":"57726e09edc2cb3880b582e1","artistName":"Jean Jansem","url":"jean-jansem","lastNameFirst":"Hovhannes \"Jean\" Semerdjian","birthDay":"/Date(-1572048000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1377561600000)/","birthDayAsString":"March 9, 1920","deathDayAsString":"August 27, 2013","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/22a8bb66-9e10-4e3f-9ef1-c139387f4b25.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Jansem","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7220","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d61","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e48","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e58"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Hovhannes Semerdjian was born in 1920 in Bursa, Turkey.

The first professional schools for Jansem became free academies of Montparnasse (1934-1936). He studied in the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs. His teachers were Brianshon, Legjon and Udon. Jansem also studied at the Sabatie studio for a year. Early paintings by Jansem were mainly to national issues. He had individual exhibitions in Paris, New York, Chicago, London, Tokyo, Rome, Brussels, Lausanne, Beirut etc. Hovhannes Semerdjian was elected the President of the Young Artists' Saloon in 1956.\r\nHe won the Comparison prize in Mexico in 1958. In Japan, two museums were built to honor Jansem′s work, located in Tokyo Ginza and Nagano Prefecture Azumino. In 1973 he visited Armenia for the first time. In 2001, 34 of his paintings were given to the Armenian Genocide Museum.\r\nThe act of painting reveals who we are. We are betrayed by what we love.\r\n— Jean Jansem\r\nAzumino Jansem Museum\r\nJansem’s primary sources of inspiration were Goya and Brueghel. His mother and his children were the main heroes in his earlier works. Jansem was characterized as a miserablist, an artist of unfortunate people.\r\nOn 10 March 2010, the day after Jansem's 90th birthday, during a visit to France, the President of Armenia awarded Jansem a medal of honour saying the following, \"Our nation is proud of you and values highly your art. While living outside Armenia, you have made our country more recognizable, extending our nation's good name all over the world.\"\r\nJansem died on 27 August 2013, aged 93, outside Paris.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":" Հովհաննես \"Ժանսեմ\" Միրիջանի Սեմերջյան","relatedArtists":["57726de5edc2cb3880b5314d","57726da5edc2cb3880b4c9a7","59b0e214edc2c922c86292d3","58062f85edc2cd6c3c9595ba","57726db1edc2cb3880b4dd68","58dbb9b2edc2c958ec631651","5784c09dedc2cb202cf55235","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f3a4","57726d86edc2cb3880b490ab","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e6b0","57726dd8edc2cb3880b51cbc","57726dd4edc2cb3880b5155e","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a8f8","57726d94edc2cb3880b4accd","57726dcdedc2cb3880b50b54","578d0fd3edc2c979a8af80e6","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aace","58718ccdedc2c949a4235b69","57726de3edc2cb3880b52eb6","57726dd6edc2cb3880b51820"]},{"id":"57726d87edc2cb3880b49407","artistName":"Richard Lindner","url":"richard-lindner","lastNameFirst":"Lindner Richard","birthDay":"/Date(-2150323200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(261532800000)/","birthDayAsString":"November 11, 1901","deathDayAsString":"April 16, 1978","image":"https://uploads.wikiart.org/Content/images/ARTIST-480x600.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lindner_(painter)","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d71","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7248"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Richard Lindner ","relatedArtists":["5a35ca02edc2c90f18f65a76","57726dc4edc2cb3880b4fd3f","592e4177edc2c97bc8fa78c8","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e6de","57726db2edc2cb3880b4df81","57726ddbedc2cb3880b520bb","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ac84","57726dd6edc2cb3880b518bb","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51efe","57726da6edc2cb3880b4ccf3","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4bfba","57726dbcedc2cb3880b4f02e","57726dbcedc2cb3880b4ef97","57726df3edc2cb3880b546da","57726e06edc2cb3880b5652b","57726dfcedc2cb3880b55425","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ec43","582a8625edc2c9a69c2994e2","57726d9aedc2cb3880b4b78c","5bcfea16edc2c921380700bf"]},{"id":"57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a159","artistName":"Heorhiy Narbut","url":"heorhiy-narbut","lastNameFirst":"Narbut Heorhiy","birthDay":"/Date(-2646000000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-1565568000000)/","birthDayAsString":"February 25, 1886","deathDayAsString":"May 23, 1920","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/0f399410-0500-48c1-8824-aac10cb8ea12.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heorhiy_Narbut","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d41","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad65d0","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7200"],"periods":[{"id":"57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a15d","title":"Kievan period"},{"id":"57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a15f","title":"Petersburg period"},{"id":"57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a161","title":"Early period"}],"series":[{"id":"57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a163","title":"The crane and heron.

His gaze was trained in reading the light and translating it into pure forces of colour. He created a painting en plein air that is truly colouristic, with powerful harmonies, which convincingly interpret the nature of Greek light. In his mature work, Panayiotis Tetsis literally builds with colour. He translates light and shadow into calculated units of pure and gleaming colour, constructing a sunny and light universe. A neglected quality in the approach of modern painting to colour, the light provides the basis for the artist to lay out colour in his works. Yet, in his painting, Tetsis did not ignore the contributions of Abstraction. Each section of his painting can be read as pure painting and as part of the enigma of the image.\r\n\r\nAs a thinker of the gaze, Panayiotis Tetsis seeks the absolute. He guides the viewer’s gaze toward the inner motions of the soul. This is why he only paints what he is intimately familiar with: his friends, landscapes from the island of Hydra or Sifnos, the last rays of the sun, the Friday open-air market on Xenokratous Street, in Athens, and still-life paintings, depicting objects with which the artist maintains a constant tactile and visual relationship.

Childish's\r\ndefiance to authority and his insistence on integrity and personal style above\r\nthe formalities of educational requirement led to his eventual expulsion from\r\nart school in 1981. Childish then embarked on an artistic, literary, and musical\r\nodyssey exploring a broad range of worldly themes including war, history,\r\nsocial protest, art hate, religious philosophy, as well his own experiences of\r\nalcoholism, and the sexual abuse he suffered as a child. Over 35 years of\r\ncontinual creative activity Childish has gained a cult status worldwide; writing\r\nand publishing over 40 volumes of confessional poetry, 5 novels, recorded\r\nover 100 LPs, and painted several hundreds painting.\r\n\r\nBilly Childish has had solo and group exhibitions internationally including\r\nNew York, London, Seoul and Berlin.

Sterne was, in fact, the only woman photographed with the group by Nina Leen for Life magazine in 1950. In her artistic endavors she created a body of work known for exhibiting a stubborn independence from styles and trends, including Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism, with which she is often associated.\r\n\r\nSterne has been almost completely overlooked in art historical narratives of the post-war American art scene. At the time of her death, possibly the last surviving artist of the first-generation of the New York School, Hedda Sterne viewed her widely varied works more as in flux than as definitive statements. In 1944 she married Saul Steinberg the Romanian-born American cartoonist and illustrator, best known for his work for The New Yorker.\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1940s she became a member of The Irascible Eighteen, a group of abstract painters who protested the Metropolitan Museum of Art's policy towards American painting of the 1940s and who posed for a famous picture in 1950; members of the group besides Sterne included: Willem de Kooning, Adolph Gottlieb, Ad Reinhardt, Richard Pousette-Dart, William Baziotes, Jimmy Ernst, Jackson Pollock, James Brooks, Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Theodoros Stamos, Barnett Newman, and Mark Rothko.\r\n\r\nHer works are in the collections of museums including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., and the National Museum of Women in the Arts, also in Washington D.C.

He was the co-inventor of Dadaism and a leading exponent of Constructivism in Eastern Europe. In the 1910s, he co-edited, with Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara, the Romanian art magazine Simbolul. Janco was a practitioner of Art Nouveau, Futurism and Expressionism before contributing his painting and stage design to Tzara's literary Dadaism. He parted with Dada in 1919, when he and painter Hans Arp founded a Constructivist circle, Das Neue Leben.\r\n\r\nReunited with Vinea, he founded Contimporanul, the influential tribune of the Romanian avant-garde, advocating a mix of Constructivism, Futurism and Cubism. At Contimporanul, Janco expounded a \"revolutionary\" vision of urban planning. He designed some of the most innovative landmarks of downtown Bucharest. He worked in many art forms, including illustration, sculpture and oil painting.\r\n\r\nJanco was one of the leading Romanian Jewish intellectuals of his generation. Targeted by antisemitic persecution before and during World War II, he emigrated to British Palestine in 1941. He won the Dizengoff Prize and Israel Prize, and was a founder of Ein Hod, a utopian art colony, controversially built over a deserted Palestinian Arab settlement.\r\n\r\nMarcel Janco was the brother Georges and Jules Janco, who were his artistic partners during and after the Dada episode. His brother-in-law and fellow Constructivist promoter was the writer Jacques G. Costin, known as a survivor of 1940s antisemitism.

His travels in Europe and the USA led him to meet artists such as Arshile Gorky, René Magritte, Salvador Dalí, André Breton, and Le Corbusier. Matta was of Spanish, Basque and French descent.\r\n\r\nIt was Breton who provided the major spur to the Chilean's direction in art, encouraging his work and introducing him to the leading members of the Paris Surrealist movement.

It has been said of Soto's art that it is inseparable from the viewer; it can only stand completed in the illusion perceived by the mind as a result of observing the piece.\r\n\r\nFrom 1970 until the early 1990s, Soto's works appeared in places such as the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, as well as the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, the Jesús Soto Museum of Modern Art opened in Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela with a collection of his work - a large number of the exhibits are wired to the electricity supply so that they can move. The Venezuelan architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva designed the building for the museum and the Italian op artist Getulio Alviani was called to direct it.\r\n\r\nSome of Soto's work adorns Caracas' main arts centre, the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex.\r\n\r\nJesús Rafael Soto died in 2005 in Paris, and is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse.

His paintings are associated with the Color Field movement and Post-painterly Abstraction.\r\n\r\nIn his early stages, Bush was influenced by the work of Charles Comfort and the Group of Seven. During the 1930s, he ran a commercial art business and, by night, furthered his studies at the Ontario College of Art. Bush, like other Canadian artists of the time, was sheltered from major European influences. After seeing the work of the American Abstract Expressionists in New York City, Bush's canvases changed dramatically.\r\n\r\nBush developed his work and approach to abstraction through the 1950s. He was a member of Painters Eleven, the group founded by William Ronald in 1953 to promote abstract painting in Canada, and was soon encouraged in his art by the American art critic Clement Greenberg. Critical at first, Greenberg became a mentor to Bush and encouraged him to refine his palette, technique, and approach. As a result of Greenberg's guidance, Bush became closely tied to Color Field Painting. Bush became friends with artists associated with color-field like Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland and also Anthony Caro. As Painters Eleven disbanded in 1960, Bush moved on, and in the end became one of the more successful artists to come from this group.\r\n\r\nJack Bush represented Canada at the 1967 São Paulo Art Biennial, and in 1976 the Art Gallery of Ontario toured a large retrospective of his work. He died in 1977. His son Terry was an award winning jingle writer, best known for singing \"Maybe Tomorrow\", the theme for the The Littlest Hobo.\r\n\r\nCanada Post honored Jack Bush with a Canadian postage stamp and a souvenir sheet released on March 20, 2009. The stamps featured his 1964 painting, Striped Column and his 1977 painting Chopsticks.

At 25 he painted a self-portrait full of premonition as he showed himself with a deformed hand and with the veins of his arm cut. He chose to kill himself 27 years later by cutting his veins.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 Domínguez met André Breton, a theoretician of Surrealism, and Paul Éluard, known as the poet of this movement, and took part a year later in the Surrealist exhibition held in Copenhagen and those of London and Tenerife in 1936.\r\n\r\nHe took up the Russian-invented technique of decalcomania in 1936, using gouache spread thinly on a sheet of paper or other surface (glass has been used), which is then pressed onto another surface such as a canvas.\r\n\r\nHis 1937 oil painting The Infernal Machine sold for 2 770 000 FF (US $ 404,375) on June 8, 2000 at Drouot-Montaigne in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn 1952 he started an affair with Marie-Laure de Noailles, who called him \"putchie\".\r\n\r\nDomínguez committed suicide December 31, 1957, by slitting his wrists in the bath.

In 1968, he became a Companion of the Order of Canada. He was also a member of the Royal Canadian Academy. In 1997, he was posthumously made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec.

He studied at Randolph-Macon College, Ashland, Virginia, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1948. He then studied at the Pratt Institute, a well-known art school in Brooklyn, New York, until 1950. That year he received a grant from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, enabling him to travel to Europe, where he studied briefly at the Académie Julian in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn 1951 he returned to the United States, and after serving in the U.S. Army, settled in Washington, D.C., where he began to teach, in 1953. The following summer, he enrolled in a summer institute at Catholic University, studying under Kenneth Noland. He became a friend of Noland, who became a significant influence on Downing's art and who was one of the founders of the Washington Color Field Movement.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1950s, Downing shared a studio with Howard Mehring, another artist of the Washington Color School and Color Field painting. In 1964 Clement Greenberg included Noland, Mehring, Downing and others in his traveling museum exhibition called Post-painterly Abstraction.\r\n\r\nFrom 1965 to 1968, Downing taught at the Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington, D.C. There he taught several people who in their turn became artists influenced by Downing's ideas, including Sam Gilliam.\r\n\r\nHis paintings to a large extent consisted of circles arranged in precise patterns on the canvas, with colors often chosen according to ideas of symmetry. Downing's Spot Paintings are his best known works, being often compared with the more recent spot paintings by contemporary artist Damien Hirst.\r\n\r\nIn the last ten years of his life, Downing lived in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He died in October 1985 in Provincetown, Massachusetts at the age of 57. In its obituary the Washington Times characterized his death as mysterious. The newspaper was referring to the then recent demise of Washington Color Field artist Gene Davis (1920–1985) and to the earlier death of Howard Mehring (1931–1978), as well.

He builds posters in which one has been placed over another or others, and the top poster or posters have been ripped, revealing to a greater or lesser degree the poster or posters underneath. He is a member of the Nouveau Réalisme art group (1960–1963). His work has primarily focused on the anonymous and on the marginal remains of civilization.\r\n\r\nVilleglé first started producing art in 1947 in Saint-Malo by collecting found objects (steel wires, bricks from Saint-Malo's Atlantic retaining wall). In December 1949, he concentrated his work on ripped advertising posters from the street. Working with fellow artist Raymond Hains, Villeglé began to use collage and found/ripped posters from street advertisements in creating Ultra-Lettrist psychogeographical hypergraphics in the 1950s, and in June 1953, he published Hepérile Éclaté, a phonetic poem by Camille Bryen, which was made unreadable when read through strips of grooved glass made by Hains. In February 1954, Villeglé and Hains met the Lettrist poet François Dufrêne, and this latter introduced them to Yves Klein, Pierre Restany and Jean Tinguely. In 1958, Villeglé published an overview of his work on ripped posters, Des Réalités collectives, which is to a certain degree a prefiguration of the manifesto of the New Realism group (1960) which he joined at its inception.

We know of her from a signature and what may be a self-portrait in a twelve-century German psalter (a manuscript of the psalms).\r\n\r\nThe 'Claricia Psalter' was made for, and most likely by, a group of Benedictine nuns at the abbey of Saints Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg, Germany. Although the psalter itself, along with its calendar, dates to the late-12th or early 13th century, a number of texts and prayers were added in the mid-13th century. Most striking about the manuscript are its illuminations, which include a prefatory cycle, full-page miniatures, and historiated initials. While all are Romanesque in style, they vary greatly in quality and technique, and three or four different artists seem to have been at work. The psalter takes its name from one of the initials, which depicts a young girl in secular dress swinging from the initial \"Q,\" who has \"Claricia\" written around her head. It has been suggested that the image represents a novice artist who signed her work, but there are many other theories, none of which is certain.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Clarica","relatedArtists":["58334c49edc2c9a7e450d340","57726e03edc2cb3880b55f63","57726e03edc2cb3880b55fea","57726e03edc2cb3880b55f8b","57726e03edc2cb3880b55fdc"]},{"id":"5784bfadedc2cb202cf438f1","artistName":"Cassandre","url":"cassandre","lastNameFirst":"Cassandre","birthDay":"/Date(-2175465600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-48643200000)/","birthDayAsString":"January 24, 1901","deathDayAsString":"June 17, 1968","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/9a64e6b8-f017-4635-a429-7affa0465c90.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandre_(artist)","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4e29","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee8","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7200"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron","relatedArtists":["57726e06edc2cb3880b56517","57726d82edc2cb3880b48728","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b4e9","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f2b9","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4ba1f","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bdcb","57726d8cedc2cb3880b49e7e","57726dfdedc2cb3880b554b9","57726dcbedc2cb3880b50737","57726dfcedc2cb3880b55306","57726d85edc2cb3880b48d99","57726dcbedc2cb3880b50727","57726d7aedc2cb3880b478db"]},{"id":"578621d3edc2cc202cae9b86","artistName":"Clarence Gagnon","url":"clarence-gagnon","lastNameFirst":"Gagnon Clarence ","birthDay":"/Date(-2781648000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-883267200000)/","birthDayAsString":"November 8, 1881","deathDayAsString":"January 5, 1942","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/996648de-dd83-4786-9d43-52dd2e04e41c.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Gagnon","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d41","57726b50edc2cb3880ad72c0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d29","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Clarence Alphonse Gagnon","relatedArtists":["57726d90edc2cb3880b4a4fa","57726dffedc2cb3880b557c1","5a3a99a7edc2c934343305ee","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a7fb","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aaec","57726da8edc2cb3880b4cfd9","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f47c","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e804","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e494","57e416bcedc2cd7734cd5458","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f518","5a155491edc2c996f4521dc1","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d6ee","57726d94edc2cb3880b4aba1","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ace3","57726dfdedc2cb3880b55585","57726dceedc2cb3880b50bfc","57726df7edc2cb3880b54c1d","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e7d8","5890c3ccedc2c92d7431908f"]},{"id":"585817fdedc2c90ebc470294","artistName":"Aldo Locatelli","url":"aldo-locatelli","lastNameFirst":"Locatelli Aldo","birthDay":"/Date(-1715904000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(126230400000)/","birthDayAsString":"August 18, 1915","deathDayAsString":"1974","image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00111/images//aldo-locatelli-foto-ronaldo-karam.png!Portrait.png","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Locatelli","dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad72c8","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e68","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d0","57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce1","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f28"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1931,"activeYearsCompletion":1958,"biography":"Aldo Locatelli (Bergamo, August 18, 1915 – Porto Alegre, September 3, 1962) was an Italian painter.

Bell is a renowned American artist (b. 1971), most famous for his thematic gangster series paintings and an infamous portrait painting clientele, which includes the late John Gotti and numerous actors from The Sopranos, Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale and more.\r\n\r\nBorn April 10th, on his Mother's birthday, Bell was naturally gifted in art and experienced success at an early age, winning 1st Place in his first juried art exhibition at age 5. As an emerging artist he spent a lot of his time in and around New York City, studying art with his maternal grandmother, a self-taught artist from Lyndhurst, NJ. It was during this time period when Bell began exploring life's very personal & psychological issues visually through his paintings.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Bell’s accomplishments in the art world, he has completed his first screenplay based on real-life events surrounding his Ticket to Ride painting series. His artwork is also featured on Sopranos star Joseph R. Gannascoli's new CUGINE Cigar Line and is working on a new \"Seven Scars\" series for VH1's MOB WIVES Toni Marie Ricci for 2013.\r\n\r\nAs a pioneer of the Visual Journaling movement, Bell recently expanded his advocacy for arts education globally by participating in artist friend, Eric Fischl’s America: Now and Here project. Bell holds a B.F.A. from Lycoming College, an M.Ed. from Towson University, and recently won the 2013 William U. Harris Award of Excellence.

cinema, art researcher and theorist. He was one of the most significant figures of Georgian modernism. He was born in 1889, in the village of Kukhi, Georgia. After finishing Kutaisi gymnasium, he studied at the faculty of Natural Sciences within St. Petersburg University. Simultaneously, he worked in the studio of the painter L. Dimitryev-Kavkazsky. After a brief period of working as a painter and educator in Tbilisi, he went to Paris where he lived from 1919 to 1927. He partook in the Société des Artistes Indépendants exhibitions and joint exhibitions with the Georgian artists Lado Gudiashvili and Shalva Kikodze. In 1926, the founders of ‘Société Anonyme’ -- Catherin Drier, Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, with collaboration of Wassily Kandinsky, Kurt and Helen Schwitters, Fernand Leger, Heinrich Kampendonk and Anton Giulio Bragaglia -- arranged a big international exhibition of modern art at the Brooklyn Museum. For this reason, Société Anonyme which was also known as an “Experimental Museum,” purchased Davit Kakabadze’s works. Among the works was the sculpture “Z,” which today is kept at Yale University Art Gallery together with his other works. See the list of participants in the catalogue of the exhibition dedicated to the 60th anniversary of Kandinsky at http://artgallery.yale.edu/socanon/ as well as some pages of the catalogue on our website.\r\n\r\nThe Brooklyn Museum exhibition opened on 19 November, 1926 and closed on 1 January, 1927. And this was the fatal year when Kakabadze returned to the annexed and Soviet-dominated Georgia after travelling to Germany, Italy and Greece. Indeed, after returning to Georgia and mounting a one-man exhibition at the “Orient Hotel” in 1928, he produced no art until 1933. The artist himself called these years his “silent period.” In 1930s his works, especially of Parisian period are considered formalistic. He was forced to compromise and in 1933 creates graphic series “Rioni Power Station” while in 1940-1950s creates pictures on industrial themes. On July 12, 1948 the order was issued to the Tbilisi Academy of Art that he “could not instruct students according to the socialist realism method and he was dismissed from his position from the 1948-49 academic year.”  Davit Kakabadze died unexpectedly on 10 May, 1952.

Hambleton is a conceptual artist based in New York's Lower East Side. His exhibition record spans over three decades and includes work from both street and studio practices. Hambleton was an integral figure in the street art movement of the 80's which included the likes of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. His projects continue to be a working model for emerging street and conceptually-based artists today.\r\n\r\nHambleton's first widely publicized public art project was a series from 1976-1979 entitled \"Image Mass Murder.\" With this series, Hambleton staged fictitious, often graphic, murder scenes using chalk outlines and red paint in urban areas designated as \"low crime.\" In 1982, Hambleton began his most widely known urban art project, the \"Shadowman\" series. Hambleton painted shadow figures into the landscape of New York City from 1982-1986. He continues to explore landscape in his current series, \"The Beautiful Paintings.\" Feature articles on Hambleton can be found in Art in America, Life Magazine, People, and The New York Times, among others.\r\n\r\nHis work has been exhibited in museums and galleries around the world, including PS1, the Brooklyn Museum, the New Museum, and Kunsthalle Wien.\r\n

\r\nBashinjaghian's best known works include Birch Grove (1883), Alazani Valley (1902), Ararat (1912). All are in the National Gallery of Armenia in Yerevan. His other works are located in Art Museum of Georgia, Museum of Oriental Art (Moscow), and the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.\r\nBashinjaghian was born on 16 September 1857 in a small town of Sighnaghi in eastern Georgian province of Kakheti, part of the Russian Empire at the time.  After finishing the local school, he was admitted to the Arts School. In 1878, Bashinjaghian moved to the Russian capital St. Petersburg, where he became a student at the Imperial Academy of Arts a year later. Mikhail Clodt was one of his teachers. He graduated from the Academy in 1883, also winning a silver medal for his Birch Grove.\r\nHe returned to his hometown Sighnaghi the same year and soon started to travel throughout the Caucasus: Lake Sevan, Yerevan, Ashtarak and the holy capital of the Armenian Church - Ejmiatsin, Georgia and the Northern Caucasus, which caused the artist to make a row of canvas of the local landscapes. During the next year, Bashinjaghian visited Italy and Switzerland, where he learnt about the classic European art and also saw the Alps. He later wrote that \"the Alps are beautiful, but they cannot win your heart if you have seen the Caucasus.\r\nHe returned to Russia and settled in Tiflis, the largest city of the Caucasus and the cultural center of Armenians of Russia. In 1890s Bashinjaghian had exhibitions in Moscow, Odessa, St. Petersburg and Novocherkassk. In 1897, he created a series of oil painting of Ani, the medievial Armenian capital of thousand churches. From 1899 to 1901, Bashinjaghian lived in Paris with his wife Ashkhen Katanian and their three children. In France, he made a trip throughout the country and produced over 30 paintings.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Գևորգ Բաշինջաղյան","relatedArtists":["57726db4edc2cb3880b4e20a","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ed03","58c689a3edc2c9961c6f14b8","57726dbdedc2cb3880b4f139","57726dbcedc2cb3880b4ef03","57daf96cedc2c9a198ff98d9","57726d91edc2cb3880b4a744","5b11b2bdedc2c92138f7568e","5a535a7aedc2c9e578a056db","57726dfdedc2cb3880b554a1","5977535bedc2c979ac1a0e57","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4ba42","57726df2edc2cb3880b5455e","57a2e93bedc2c92150bc344f","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b58a","5ba8faf1edc2cc18b4dbf081","57726da9edc2cb3880b4d179","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d3c3","57726d83edc2cb3880b487e0","57726e00edc2cb3880b55aeb"]},{"id":"57726e06edc2cb3880b563d9","artistName":"Alexander Bazhbeuk-Melikyan","url":"alexander-bazhbeuk-melikyan","lastNameFirst":"Alexander Bazhbeuk-Melikyan","birthDay":"/Date(-2471126400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-108950400000)/","birthDayAsString":"September 11, 1891","deathDayAsString":"July 20, 1966","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/39ef9330-efe4-4de4-ac7c-519dc3fee6f0.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bazhbeuk-Melikyan","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7220","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d61","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"\r\nAlexander Alexandrovich Bazhbeuk-Melikyan was born in Tbilisi, Georgia. In 1903, he began his studies at the School of Art and Sculpture of the Caucasus Society for the Encouragement for the Fine Arts. Here he made the acquaintance of a fellow student, Lado Gudiashvili. In 1910, he travelled to Moscow to begin training in the studio of the artist V. N. Meshkov. The following year, he joined the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts.\r\nIn 1913, Bazhbeuk-Melikyan was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army, and spent the World War I years on the Odessa front.\r\nIn 1917, he returned to Tbilisi and began his own independent artistic career.\r\nIn 1919, he met his first wife, Nektar, with whom he had one daughter, Lavinia (born in 1922). From a later marriage to Lydia Meshkorudnikova, he had two more children: a son, Vazgen, and a daughter, Zuleika. Both daughters were to become artists in their own right.\r\nBetween the years 1922 - 1929, Bazhbeuk-Melikyan taught at the studio of Mose Toidze, following which he taught at the Georgian Academy of Arts till 1938.\r\nIn the 1920s, Bazhbeuk-Melikyan was an active participant in the Tbilisi avant-garde, collaborating with Futurists such as the poet Kara-Darvish, and Georgian painters such as David Kakabadze. In 1935, Bazhbeuk-Melikyan became friends with the nationalist poets Yegishe Charents and Titian Tabidze, which led to the attention of the NKVD. When, in 1937, the newspaper Dawn of the East published an article naming him an enemy of the people, he was expelled from the Union of Artists of Georgia. Charents and Tabidze were both executed that same year, and Bazhbeuk-Melikyan lived in fear of arrest. That did not come to pass, and when he painted his Spanish guerrillas in support of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, he was rehabilitated.[2]\r\nIn 1961, he was awarded the title of Honored Artist of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.\r\nHis family estimates that Bazhbeuk-Melikyan painted over two thousand canvases, but ruthlessly pruned them down to about a hundred. Given his perfectionism, every time he created a new work, he would go over his old paintings and destroy any that did not meet his uncompromising standard. When his daughter Lavinia created a catalogue of his paintings in 1936, there were 110 pieces. In 1966, after his death, there still were only 110 works remaining.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Ալեքսանդր Բաժբեուկ-Մելիքյան ","relatedArtists":["57726de3edc2cb3880b52d44","57726db1edc2cb3880b4dd10","57726d93edc2cb3880b4a9ae","588cbba3edc2c997d8ba3c88","5bc97eb8edc2c91b68b6b153","588d86ddedc2c96328482e55","57726d89edc2cb3880b496eb","57726d86edc2cb3880b49119","57726d85edc2cb3880b48ea9","57726d95edc2cb3880b4ad2c","57726decedc2cb3880b53bd2","57726e00edc2cb3880b559cc","57726db9edc2cb3880b4eba3","57726dc9edc2cb3880b503fa","57726ddeedc2cb3880b52631","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4bb96","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51f94","57726ddfedc2cb3880b5279f","57726de4edc2cb3880b52f22","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4c04c"]},{"id":"57726e09edc2cb3880b582f5","artistName":"John Leech","url":"john-leech","lastNameFirst":"Leech John ","birthDay":"/Date(-4807468800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-3318969600000)/","birthDayAsString":"August 29, 1817","deathDayAsString":"October 29, 1864","image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/john-leech.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leech_(caricaturist)","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e8","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e28","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e70","57726a66edc2ca38801d4cf1","57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce9"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"57726e09edc2cb3880b582f9","title":"A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, by Charles Dickens"},{"id":"57726e09edc2cb3880b582fb","title":"The Life of a Foxhound, by John Mills"},{"id":"57726e09edc2cb3880b582fd","title":"The Battle of Life, by Charles Dickens"},{"id":"57726e09edc2cb3880b582ff","title":"Mr. Punch's Railway Book, edited by J.

He created extensive and high value compositional paintings, portraits, landscapes, graphics, thematic compositions, book designs.\r\n\r\nThe basis of his art is humanism and deep patriotism, the sources of his inspiration are Armenian insights, which are expressed in the characters of David of Sassoun, Tsovinar, Sanasar, Baghdasar, David Beck, Sayat Nova, Aksel Bakunts, Tamantsiner and other characters of great national figures. During the Great Patriotic War he depicted the heroic image of Soviet people (\"Battle for a city\", 1942, \"Tanya\", 1946), national liberation struggle of the Armenian people (\"David Beck\", 1945).\r\n\r\nEduard Isabekyan was the founder of thematic compositional genre in Armenia. The basis of his art is the history of Armenian nation and its future, its proud posture and the ecstatic potential. Isabekyan’s works of thematic compositional genre are the achievement of Armenian fine art of the Soviet period. \"Young David\" (1956, The National Gallery of Armenia), \"The Revolt of Haghpat Peasants in 1903\" (1957), \"Reply to Hazkert\" (1960, The National Gallery of Armenia) and other paintings distinguish by their monumental expressiveness, dynamic composition and civic resonance.\r\n\r\nA number of Isabekyan’s paintings are characterized by organic intercourse of a man and the native nature: \"Old Man from Byurakan and the Artavazik Church\" (1956), \"Aksel Bakunts\" (1956), \"Derenik Demirtchyan\" (1960), \"Curly Boy\" (1964), \"Sayat Nova\" (1964). One of the best examples of Armenian portraiture of Soviet period is the \"Mother’s portrait\" painting (1944). The thematic center of his landscapes is the epic description of Armenian nature, ancient fortresses and temples: \"In the Canyon of Tatev\" (1959), \"The Oxen Crossing the River by the Bridge\" (1959), \"Khndzoresk\" (1962).\r\n\r\nMany paintings are distinguished by artistic saturation: \"Horovel\" (1956, The National Gallery of Armenia), \"Near the well\" (\"They didn’t come back\", 1965), vIn the shade of the treesv (1966), \"Artavazd’s death\" (1966). The illustrations of Derenik Demirchian’s \"Vardananq\"[5] and Sero Khanzadyan’s \"Mkhitar Sparapet\" novels are also commonly known.\r\n\r\nIsabekyan is the author of a number of drawings and the series of graphics devoted to painter Arpenik Nalbandyan.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Էդուարդ Հմայակի Իսաբեկյան","relatedArtists":["57726db2edc2cb3880b4dfb1","57726ddbedc2cb3880b521c8","57726d95edc2cb3880b4aeaf","598362fcedc2c9658c38ed9e","5b089955edc2c90a10e60b3e","57726d85edc2cb3880b48d99","5a9b426bedc2c968080a7c9e","57726db1edc2cb3880b4dd28","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a3db","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a4fa","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e089","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a21d","57726dfeedc2cb3880b556ec","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa47","57726d83edc2cb3880b48a13","57726e06edc2cb3880b5638b","57726db9edc2cb3880b4eaa1","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ac6c","57726d89edc2cb3880b4965f","57726d7eedc2cb3880b47f72"]},{"id":"57726da4edc2cb3880b4c911","artistName":"Anne Appleby","url":"anne-appleby","lastNameFirst":"Appleby Anne","birthDay":"/Date(-504921600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1954","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/30c55ce9-f1f1-4396-b958-6994cc4ab317.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Appleby","dictionaries":["5804eadaedc2ce45b4e01a76","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4eb9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Anne Appleby is an American color field painter. Her works, always bearing titles from the natural world---\"Sweet Pine\", \"Summer Aspen\", \"Gem\"---are simple arrangements of colored canvas panels. Each panel is, at a glance, monochromatic, but closer inspection reveals deep and luminous gradations of hue, incremental tonal variations. Although associated by some with reductivism/minimalism, Appleby comes with a different philosophy, as her glowing fields of colors are inspired by landscapes and plants. \r\n\r\nAppleby grew up in Pennsylvania, and moved to Montana at age 17. She received her B.F.A. in 1977 from the San Francisco Art Institute. Before attending the Art Institute in San Francisco, Appleby spent a fifteen year apprenticeship with an Ojibwe Indian elder in Montana. She learned patient observation of nature from him. Appleby would watch and translate into color the amazing cycles in her vast backyard of Montana. Leaves, stems, buds, fruit, seeds and more are transformed into two-dimensional portraits of captured moments in nature's fluid evolution. She has started exhibiting in the early '80s, but only achieved moderate success before the mid '90s. Currently her CV counts more than 30 solo exhibitions, 3 awards and artworks present in a few museums, including the San Francisco MoMA.\r\n\r\nNow, she lives at the edge of a national forest in St. Helena, Montana. She shows her paintings primarily at San Francisco’s Gallery Paule Anglim. She has worked in printmaking since 1997 at Crown Point Press.

In 1924-25 he is co-founder of the Integral revue (which promotes ”integralism”, which includes elements from constructivism, futurism, cubism and other movements) and of the Academy of Modern and Decorative Art, done on the model of Bauhaus. In 1926, he creates at Paris the scenery and costumes for a play by Pirandello and another play by Gide. His artworks tend to lean towards social themes after 1930. In 1949, Maxy becomes the director of the Art Museum of Romania and he was also an university professor for about 3 years.

He was born Robert Clark in New Castle, Indiana. His family relocated to Indianapolis, where he graduated from Arsenal Technical High School. He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago (1949–53), the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine (summer 1953) and Edinburgh University and Edinburgh College of Art (1953–4), before settling in New York in 1954. There he began making art with distinctive imagery drawing on commercial art approaches blended with existentialism, that gradually moved toward what Indiana calls \"sculptural poems\".\r\n\r\nIndiana's work often consists of bold, simple, iconic images, especially numbers and short words like EAT, HUG, and, his best known example, LOVE. Other well-known works by Indiana include: his painting the unique basketball court formerly used by the Milwaukee Bucks in that city's U.S. Cellular Arena, with a large M shape taking up each half of the court; his sculpture in the lobby of Taipei 101, called 1-0 (2002, aluminum), using multicoloured numbers to suggest the conduct of world trade and the patterns of human life; and the works he created in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks and exhibited in New York in 2004 called the Peace Paintings.

He was best known for his handmade series of painted round wooden bars, challenging the boundaries between painting and sculpture. Cadere was one of the first artists to realize that objects were inseparable from market and institutional contexts: half of his focus was on the systems of distribution in the art world, as he introduced bars in galleries and retract them, usually carrying a bar like a staff. His bars could be positioned in all sorts of relations to their surroundings (on walls, floors, propped between the two, etc.), but he would also carry them around a number of outdoor locations and into other people’s shows and openings, even when not invited, which made him quite ”infamous” at the time.

Horowitz (b. 1976) is a Los Angeles-­based artist working in photography, painting, performance, and social practice. Horowitz holds a master’s degree in art from the University of Southern California, and bachelor’s degrees in art and marketing from San Francisco Art Institute, and Indiana University Kelley School of Business respectively. In a\npractice that combines traditional drawing, commercial photography, and new media, Horowitz turns American culture on its head to explore the idiosyncrasies of entertainment, class, commerce, failure, success, and personal meaning.

He first came into contact with contemporary art as a teenager through the magazine D’Ací i D’Allà, published in Barcelona, and during the Spanish Civil War (1936–9), while he was still at school, he taught himself to draw and paint. On a French government scholarship in the early 1950s he lived in Paris, to which he often returned. Both in Europe and beyond, the highly influential French critic and curator Michel Tapié (no relation, despite the similar name) enthusiastically promoted the work of Antoni Tàpies.\r\n\r\nIn 1948, Tàpies helped co-found the first Post-War Movement in Spain known as Dau al Set which was connected to the Surrealist and Dadaist Movements. The main leader and founder of Dau al Set was the poet Joan Brossa. The movement also had a publication of the same name, Dau al Set. Tàpies started as a surrealist painter, his early works were influenced by Paul Klee and Joan Miró; but soon become an informal artist, working in a style known as pintura matèrica, in which non artistic materials are incorporated into the paintings. In 1953 he began working in mixed media; this is considered his most original contribution to art. One of the first to create serious art in this way, he added clay and marble dust to his paint and used waste paper, string, and rags (Grey and Green Painting, Tate Gallery, London, 1957).\r\n\r\nTàpies' international reputation was well established by the end of the 1950s. From the late 1950s to early 1960s, Tàpies worked with Enrique Tábara, Antonio Saura, Manolo Millares and many other Spanish Informalist artists. In 1966 he was arrested at a clandestine assembly at the University of Barcelona; his work of the early 1970s is marked by symbols of Catalan identity (which was anathema to Franco). In 1974 he made a series of lithographs called Assassins and displayed them in the Galerie Maeght in Paris, in honour of regime critic Salvador Puig Antich's memory. From about 1970 (influenced by Pop art) he began incorporating more substantial objects into his paintings, such as parts of furniture. Tàpies's ideas have had worldwide influence on art, especially in the realms of painting, sculpture, etchings and lithography. Examples of his work are found in numerous major international collections.\r\n\r\nThe paintings produced by Tàpies later in the 1970s and in the 1980s reveal his application of this aesthetic of meditative emptiness, for example in spray-painted canvases with linear elements suggestive of Oriental calligraphy, in mixed-media paintings that extended the vocabulary of Art informel, and in his oblique allusions to imagery within a fundamentally abstract idiom, as in Imprint of a Basket on Cloth (1980). Among the artists' work linked in style to that of Tàpies is that of the American painter Julian Schnabel as both have been connected to the art term \"Matter\".\r\n\r\nAlongside his production of pictures and objects, since 1947 Tàpies has been active in the field of graphic work and essays. In 1984 Tàpies created the Tàpies Foundation, dedicated to the study of modern art. In 1990 it opened a museum and library in the premises of a former publishing house in Barcelona.

He trained at the Cleveland Institute of Art in Cleveland, Ohio (1948–1953), and then with Josef Albers at the Yale University School of Art and Architecture in New Haven, Connecticut (1953–1955) where he earned his Masters of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the founders and foremost exponents of Op Art, a movement during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Victor Vasarely in France and Bridget Riley in England were his primary international counterparts. In 1964, Life magazine called him \"one of the new wizards of Op\". More recently, while reflecting on a New York City gallery show of Anuszkiewicz's from 2000, the New York Times art critic Holland Cotter described Anuszkiewicz's paintings by stating, \"The drama -- and that feels like the right word -- is in the subtle chemistry of complementary colors, which makes the geometry glow as if light were leaking out from behind it.\" Anuszkiewicz has exhibited at the Venice Biennale, Florence Biennale and Documenta, and his works are in permanent collections internationally.\r\n\r\nConsidered a major force in the Op Art movement, Anuszkiewicz is concerned with the optical changes that occur when different high-intensity colors are applied to the same geometric configurations. Most of his work comprises visual investigations of formal structural and color effects, many of them nested square forms similar to the work of his mentor Josef Albers. In his series, \"Homage to the Square,\" Albers experimented with juxtapositions of color, and Anuszkiewicz developed these concepts further. Anuszkiewicz has continued to produce works in the Op Art style over the last few decades.\r\n\r\nAnuszkiewicz summarizes his approach to painting as follows: \"My work is of an experimental nature and has centered on an investigation into the effects of complementary colors of full intensity when juxtaposed and the optical changes that occur as a result, and a study of the dynamic effect of the whole under changing conditions of light, and the effect of light on color.\" (from a statement by the artist for the exhibition \"Americans 1963\" at the Museum of the Modern Art) ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Richard Anuszkiewicz","relatedArtists":["57726dd0edc2cb3880b50f61","57726dddedc2cb3880b5243b","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c510","57726daeedc2cb3880b4d909","57726dcaedc2cb3880b5066b","57726ddcedc2cb3880b523f7","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c633","57726dc7edc2cb3880b50062","57726dd7edc2cb3880b51a9e","57726da9edc2cb3880b4d0ff","57726db4edc2cb3880b4e2c6","57726dcbedc2cb3880b50707","57726daeedc2cb3880b4d861","57726dc2edc2cb3880b4f91e","57726df6edc2cb3880b54ab8","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ec59","57726ddcedc2cb3880b523e3","57726ddcedc2cb3880b52427","57726de9edc2cb3880b53673","57726ddcedc2cb3880b5240f"]},{"id":"57726da3edc2cb3880b4c6a2","artistName":"Paul Neagu","url":"paul-neagu","lastNameFirst":"Neagu Paul","birthDay":"/Date(-1009843200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1072915200000)/","birthDayAsString":"1938","deathDayAsString":"2004","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/ea97234b-bd5c-47aa-98a2-e26f6b549649.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Neagu","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e8","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f61","57726b50edc2cb3880ad72a0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Paul Neagu was an internationally important British-Romanian artist, working in diverse media such as drawing, sculpture, performance art and watercolor.

He uses the human form as a tool, either on a canvas or in a sculpture.\n\n“Guardians of Time” relates to the idea that since the beginning of time mankind has had protectors, both for historic and mystical reasons. It seems that only man himself is a potential source of danger for his own existence. In his works of art Manfred Kielnhofer deals with the natural human desire for security. Thus his oeuvre reflects genuine exploration, consideration and discussion of current as well as historic moods and sensibilities of his social environment. His works of art captivate with elaborate combinations of light and different technique.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Kili","relatedArtists":["57726e01edc2cb3880b55c56","57726dc8edc2cb3880b502e4","57726dd4edc2cb3880b514da","5be368a7edc2c91e7c81b9ab","58e7860aedc2cc7670a474de","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f4f0","5ab0baa1edc2c9ad543bd814","597e9b6dedc2c9a974a5e44e","57726ddcedc2cb3880b521e0","57726db1edc2cb3880b4de61","57726dc8edc2cb3880b502d0","595682e9edc2c9197028995e","59fc987bedc2c98c2c9ecf98","5a0a96a2edc2c9e87477ab20","57726e06edc2cb3880b5640f","59f6e6ccedc2c9f1cc6b7a3f","5b3d37c8edc2c92414cbacf5","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e0e7","57726dd3edc2cb3880b5147e","5a8d2a32edc2c9fc9ccfcf54"]},{"id":"58225f87edc2cb69a08370ae","artistName":"Jerry W.

In 1959, he enrolled at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and also studied at the Art Students League of New York.\r\n\r\nHe rose to prominence in the 1960s with paintings of circles and ovals on solid—often brilliantly colored—backgrounds. These paintings conveyed a sense of movement, and were categorized by some as op art. Although he exhibited with optical artists in 1965, by 1966 he had moved away from the optical art towards looser and more painterly abstract canvases. Evolving out of impersonal color field painting of the mid-'60s (also known as post-painterly abstraction), Poons' has developed a style that is set apart from the abstract expressionism of the '50s thanks to the emphasis on the texture of the paint.\r\n\r\nHe currently resides primarily in New York City.

Atamian was the second of five children of Mıgırdiç Atamian, a goldsmith and musician, and Mary Afker. He completed his early education at the Mkhitaryan Armenian School in Pera, Istanbul. He then attended the local French school Lycée de Saint-Benoit. He continued his education at the Murad Rafaelian Armenian School in the San Lazzaro Island at Venice, Italy, where between 1887 and 1893 he took lessons from professors Antonio Ermolao Paoletti and Pietra. For a time he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, but returned to Istanbul without graduating and worked at the Yildiz Porcelain Factory from 1894 to 1896. He was appointed as the factory's chief designer. A number of his porcelain plates bearing his signature \"Atam\" are now exhibited at the Topkapi Palace. Plates which he created include portraits of Mahmud II, Selim and Abdul Mejid.\r\nHe opened his first exhibition prior to the Hamidian massacres where Armenians in Istanbul were massacred en masse. As a result of the unfavorable political conditions of the period, his work failed to arouse interest and support. Due to the massacres against Armenians, Atamian sought refuge in Paris in 1897. In Paris he illustrated nearly 150 books, including novels by such famous writers as Anatole France, Guy de Maupassant, Henri Bordeaux, and Rene Bazin and the French translation of B. Litton's The Last Days of Pompei until World War I.\r\nAtamian found success creating artwork for commercial purposes including books and magazines. He worked for leading French newspapers and magazines such as L'Illustration and Le Monde Illustre. He also created artwork for theatrical stage productions. His first oil painting was exhibited at Salon d'Automne in 1903.\r\nFrom 1903 and onwards, he participated in various exhibitions with overwhelming success. Of particular note are his landscapes and portraits shown at the annual exhibitions of the National Society of Artists in Paris. In 1923, he went for the summer to Saint-Gilles-sur-Vie in Vendée. He returned regularly until 1939. Much of his work were developed at this summer residence and it is his paintings of its beach that are his works that consolidated his reputation as an artist. He became a permanent member of the society in 1927.\r\nOne-person exhibitions of his work were held in Paris at the Allard Gallery in 1921 and in the Georges Petit Galley in 1923 and 1935, in Brussels in 1925, in Strasbourg in 1926, at the Simonson Gallery in 1928 and 1930, and at the Rosentahl Gallery in 1936. His wife died in 1941. That year, feeling the first symptoms of a contracted disease, he stopped painting while continuing to exhibit. His last known work is a self-portrait dated 1941. He died in his workshop July 30, 1947. Many of his paintings exhibited in various cities of Europe, the United States, and Japan were reproduced as postcards. His granddaughter bequeathed 42 paintings of the artist to the municipality of Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie in 1995.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Շառլ Կարապետ Ադամեան","relatedArtists":["57726db4edc2cb3880b4e23a","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e5e4","57726e05edc2cb3880b56291","57726e05edc2cb3880b561ee","57726d95edc2cb3880b4ada3","58948bf4edc2c96580cbe08b","57726e05edc2cb3880b562bb","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dc30","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a43b","59836d36edc2c9658c61e0c3","57726de5edc2cb3880b5310b","57726db4edc2cb3880b4e2f7","57726d85edc2cb3880b48f21","59679747edc2cb73d8da5822","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e6c8","57726e05edc2cb3880b56329","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a21d","57726d88edc2cb3880b494cd","59ce7095edc2c908e8135d80","57726de3edc2cb3880b52d5c"]},{"id":"57cd1623edc2c99704dd5ef9","artistName":"Guity Novin","url":"guity-novin","lastNameFirst":"Novin Guitty","birthDay":"/Date(-810950400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 21, 1944","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/c574bc1f-e42a-4926-baaa-0b02b125a846.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guity_Novin","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d61","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7320"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Guity Novin graduated from the Girl's College of Fine Arts with an honours diploma in 1965, she was admitted in the Institute of Decorative Arts in 1970 and received her BA in graphic design.

She was born in 1936 in Khorasan to a prominent dynasty. Her paternal family were well-known merchants in the north-eastern province, while her maternal family were caucasian merchants, who travelled to Iran following the Soviet Revolution and took residence in Mashhad.\n\nDarroudi discovered her passion for painting at a young age. After completing her secondary school education, she travelled to France and continued her studies at the University of Fine Arts (École des Beaux-Art). To learn the secrets of successful colour mixing, she headed to the Belgian capital and attained a course in \"stained glass\" at The Imperial and Royal Academy of Brussels. Darroudi completed her education with a degree in the History of Art at Ecole du Louvre in Paris. \n\nIn 1968 Darroudi was commissioned by the ITT corporation to create an artwork, entitled Iranian Petroleum, on the occasion of the launch of a pipeline from Abadan to Mashahr. The painting generated a great deal of media interest and was published in the likes of Time magazine, Newsweek and Life Magazine -- to name but a few. The artwork was later dubbed \"Our Veins, the Earth's Veins,\" by Ahmad Shamlu, a distinguished Iranian poet.\n\nDarroudi continues to add to her ever-growing collection. To date she has held 60 exhibitions worldwide, and contributed to some 200 group exhibitions across Europe, Central America, Japan and of course her homeland, Iran. \n\nFollowing her success in arts, Darroudi took on a new adventure. In 1966 she began to learn directing at the RCL institute in New York City. That's where she met her husband, Parviz Moghadasi, who was also studying television directing at the time. The two began to collaborate with each-other on various projects at a newly established television production company. Over the period of six years, they produced over 80 documentaries about both Iranian and international artists. Her work was consequently recognised by Iran's university of Sharif, where she was invited to lecture the History of Art as an honorary professor. \n\nDarroudi's lifetime achievements include her 60 individual exhibitions and 200 group exhibitions, art critiques published in various newspapers, colourful speeches in cultural and artistic establishments around the world, some 80 collaborative documentaries, and last but not least an autobiography, \"Distance Between Two Dots\". \nThese are the results of more than 50 years of her work in Contemporary Art of Iran.

In general, the lyrical, heroic world of legends is an indispensable part of Ali Akbar Sadeghi’s worldview, a world whose figurative representations sometimes appear in old miniature paintings or more popular forms of art, including coffeehouse painting, reverse painting on glass, imprints on wood and paper, and stunning images in lithographed books.\nHe began to teach painting in high school in the 1950s, before entering the university in 1958. His early works were with watercolor, but as of 1959, soon after entering college, he began oil painting and drawing. He initiated a particular style in Persian painting, influenced by Coffee House painting, iconography, and traditional Iranian portrait painting, following the Qajar tradition – a mixture of a kind of surrealism, influenced by the art of stained glass. He did his early works in graphics and illustration. He is among the first individuals involved in the Center for the Intellectual Development of Children and the Youth, and was among the founders of the Film Animation department of this institute.\nAside from illustration, he has published number of books for the Center for the Development of Children and the Youth, and has made seven films by using his style in painting.\nFilms produced by Sadeghi have won more than 15 awards at International Film Festivals. Also, for his book illustrations he has won four international awards.\nAfter the Iranian Revolution, Sadeghi seriously pursued painting. In 1989 he founded Sabz Gallery, which was actively and continuously exhibiting the works of Iranian painters until 2003. In 2011 His permanent works space and atelier established that continuously showcases works belonging to different periods of Sadeghi's long professional life.\nIn total, he has participated in over 50 individual and group exhibitions, over 7 volumes of books of the collection of his works have been published, and he has been a member of jury panels in over 10 international biennial exhibitions.\nSadeghi has been artistically active in the past 60 years. His style is a Persian surrealism, based on Iranian forms and compositions of traditional paintings, the use of Iranian iconography, and the use of Persian cultural motifs, signs and myths, full of movement and action, in prominent and genuine oil colors, in large frames, very personal, reminiscent of epic traditional Persian paintings and illustrations.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"علی اکبر

Parthenis represents the heroic phase of Greek modernism, which managed to break with the artistic establishment of Munich. \r\nThe cosmopolitan background of this Alexandrian painter (Italy, Vienna, Paris) may well account for his idiosyncratic eclecticism. Nevertheless \r\nhe succeeded in incorporating these various influences into his own unparalleled style marked by idealism, a certain “musicality” and rhythm, and the \r\nspiritual sublimation of his pictorial matter. His paintings executed in Vienna and in Greece during his first sojourn (1903-1907) reveal his strong attraction towards the Sezession, the Viennese version of Symbolism and Art Nouveau, and particularly Gustav Klimt: the development of the surface composition,\r\nthe high horizon without a sky, the decorative schematization, the pointillisme, and the cold colours dominate these pictures. After his contact with Parisian avant-garde (1909-1911) and his return to Greece, Parthenis interpreted the Greek light through brighter colours, influenced by post impressionist painters and the fauves. The French symbolists, both the older, like Puvis de Chavannes, and the younger, like the Nabis, and in particular Maurice Denis, appear to have marked not only the morphology, but also the thematic choices of his work, as shown in the religious compositions and the idealistic allegories, which are prominent in the artist’s creations of the thirties. \r\n\r\nThe Byzantine hagiographers and Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco) may now be added to Parthenis’ masters, within the ideological horizon of the Generation of the Thirties. In his works of this period we can trace the impact of Cubism. Parthenis’ mature paintings present us with an ideal vision of \r\nGreece, its myths and history; in this the Olympian deities, the Byzantine saints and the heroes of the Greek War of Independence live together in harmony. \r\nHis ideal figures are suspended in a type of transcendental space where time has been abolished and the remains of the visible world have turned into \r\nplatonic archetypes, with the help of an impalpable technique. The pigments have lost their material quality, turning into a purely spiritual projection. \r\nParthenis’ mature works recall supernatural acts featuring divine epiphanies.

Besides literature and painting, Almada composed ballet choreographies, and worked on tapestry, engraving, murals, caricature, mosaic, azulejo and stained glass. Having drawn inspiration from Cubism and Futurist movements, Almada-Negreiros is considered one of the pivotal figures of the Modernist movement in Portugal.\r\nHe started working as a humorist and drawer in 1911, joining the first and second Portuguese Humorist salons, in 1912 and 1913. \r\nIn 1913, Almada-Negreiros made his debut as an artist on the occasion of his first individual exhibition, at the Escola Internacional de Lisboa, featuring 90 drawings.\r\nFollowing the lead of other European vanguard movements of the early 20th century, Almada-Negreiros, along with writers Fernando Pessoa, Mário de Sá-Carneiro and painters such as Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso and Santa Rita Pintor, formed a group named \"Orpheu’s generation\". Intent on agitating, subverting and scandalizing the Portuguese conservative bourgeoisie and, by extension, all social conventions, the group launched a magazine – \"Orpheu\" – a journal of art and literature. Essentially, their aim was to produce a shift in the society’s mind frame, urging people to look to the future and to believe in their Man’s capacities.\r\nThe magazine Orpheu had two editions, the first of which was published in 1915. The group’s ideals were strongly influenced by those of the futurist movement, particularly, by the Russian futurist manifesto “A slap in the face of public taste”, issued in 1913.\r\nIn the same year, Almada-Negreiros wrote the satirical text \"Manifesto Anti-Dantas e por extensor\" This was a humorous but fierce criticism towards Julio Dantas, an influential intellectual who stoutly defended the traditional aesthetic patterns of the time and strongly opposed “vanguardism”.   \r\nBy this time, the French couple Robert and Sonia Delaunay, forced into exile by time the First World War was ravaging Europe, arrived in Portugal. The two artists, pioneers of the Orphism art movement, met Almada-Negreiros and the three established a lasting friendship.\r\nBetween the years of 1918-20 Almada-Negreiros lived in Paris, working as a dancer and as a factory worker to earn a living. Although he led a relatively isolated life, he established acquaintance with some of the most prominent artists of 20th century modern art.\r\nThe 20s were a prolific period in the life of Almada-Negreiros. He published literary works such as \"Pierrot e Arlequim\" (1924) and works on \"Nome de Guerra\" (“Name of War”); wrote articles and produced drawings for the covers of several magazines and newspapers; joined the \"Exhibition of the Five Independents\" (1923) and I e II \"Autumn Salons\" (1925 e 1926). \r\nBetween the years 1927 and 1932, Almada-Negreiros lived in Madrid, having had an active role in the artistic and literary scene of the city. \r\nHowever revolutionary his ideals were,  his stance during António de Oliveira Salazar's dictatorship was ambiguous. On the one hand, he supported contributed to promote the regime, having produced propaganda posters and public mural paintings. On the other hand, he was an assumed provocative critic of conservative and narrow-minded Portuguese society of his time.\r\nIn 1934, he married the painter Sarah Afonso and the couple had their only son, José Afonso de Almada Negreiros.\r\nAlmada-Negreiros died of heart failure in 15th June 1970.\r\n ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"José Sobral de Almada-Negreiros","relatedArtists":["57726d8cedc2cb3880b49e7e","57726ddbedc2cb3880b521c8","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dc60","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c408","57726db2edc2cb3880b4dfb1","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f43c","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4ba1f","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b4e9","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f2b9","57726da9edc2cb3880b4d161","57726d82edc2cb3880b48728","57726e06edc2cb3880b56517","57726df8edc2cb3880b54eae","598362fcedc2c9658c38ed9e","5a4cf1f1edc2c900bce1832d","5a807b0bedc2c9e730ad899a","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f450","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a159","57726dfdedc2cb3880b554b9","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c421"]},{"id":"57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bf2d","artistName":"Raoul Ubac","url":"raoul-ubac","lastNameFirst":"Ubac Raoul","birthDay":"/Date(-1872547200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(480470400000)/","birthDayAsString":"August 31, 1910","deathDayAsString":"March 24, 1985","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/051fe1c1-9f30-4086-b1a0-f8a00b0ca623.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Ubac","dictionaries":["5804eadaedc2ce45b4e01a76","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e79","57726b4bedc2cb3880ad6920","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7248","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ed8","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Raoul Ubac was a French painter, sculptor, photographer and engraver.

Petro [Xolodnyj], b 18 December 1876 in Pereiaslav, Poltava gubernia, now Kyiv Region,d 7 June 1930 in Warsaw. Distinguished painter, by profession a chemist. A graduate of the Kyiv Drawing School, he began to exhibit his work in 1910. His early paintings include A Tale of a Girl and Peacock (1916), Ivasyk and the Witch, The Wind, Kateryna, and A Gray Day. As a chemist, he was interested in paint manufacturing and application techniques. Attracted by ancient Galician icons in 1914, he became fascinated with the tempera technique and used it frequently. During the Ukrainian struggle for independence (1917–20), Kholodny worked in the Central Rada's Secretariat of Public Education and Ministry of Education. Under the Directory of the Ukrainian National Republic he was deputy minister of education. Leaving Ukraine with the Ukrainian National Republic government in 1920, he was interned by the Poles in Tarnów and in 1921 settled in Lviv.\r\nThe subsequent period proved to be the most productive one in Kholodny's artistic career. In 1922 he helped found the Circle of Promoters of Ukrainian Art and took part in its exhibitions. He began to paint icons and churches and to design stained-glass windows. His principal works of this period are the icons and stained-glass windows of the Dormition Church in Lviv, the iconostasis and murals of the Chapel of the Greek Catholic Theological Seminary in Lviv, numerous icons of the parish churches in Radelychi, Kholoiv, Borshchovychi, and Zubrets, and the stained-glass windows of the church in Mraznytsia. The basic features of his work, rooted in Ukrainian artistic traditions that grew out of the synthesis of Byzantine iconography with folk art, were compositional unity, the primacy of the line, and harmonious, warm colors. In his stained-glass windows, Kholodny juxtaposed elements of pure colored glass to achieve lightness and transparency. He painted many portraits: Volodymyr Samiilenko, Andrii Nikovsky, Yuliian Romanchuk, Rev Yosyf Slipy, and Ukrainian army officers such as generals Mykola Yunakiv, Marko Bezruchko, Volodymyr Salsky, Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko, Yurii Tiutiunnyk, and Volodymyr Sinkler and Colonel Dmytro Vitovsky. Historical compositions such as Leaving the Castle, Prince Ihor's Campaign against the Cumans, and Oh, the Rye in the Field are worthy of note.\r\nKholodny's style can be described as a mature impressionism of a Ukrainian variety that is profoundly lyrical. His neo-Byzantine works, which rivaled those of Mykhailo Boichuk, revealed new potentialities of the ancient style, free of schematism or archaism. Kholodny also worked in graphic art, developing his own style of drawing. A posthumous exhibition of his works was held in Lviv in 1931. After the Red Army occupied Lviv, many of Kholodny's works were destroyed for their allegedly ‘nationalist’ spirit and his church murals were painted over. (By Sviatoslav Hordynsky)http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/2display.asp?linkPath=pages\\K\\H\\KholodnyPetro.htm\r\nHis mother's relatives were icon painters who worked in Poltava gubernia.He graduated from gymnasium in Kyiv. For last two years of the gymnasium he attended evening classes in Kyiv  Drawing School of M.Murashko. After graduating in 1897 Natural Faculty of Kiev University, specializing in mathematics and mineralogy, taught (from 1898) in the Kyiv School of Engineering at the Department of Physics.http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Холодний_Петро_Іванович\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Петро Холодний","relatedArtists":["58942e28edc2c965802fa84b","57726dddedc2cb3880b52505","57726de5edc2cb3880b53180","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aac0","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ac6c","57726db2edc2cb3880b4df09","57726da6edc2cb3880b4ccc8","58948bf4edc2c96580cbe08b","57726decedc2cb3880b53a8d","57726df7edc2cb3880b54c1d","57726dc4edc2cb3880b4fc88","58dcc2e4edc2c910986e1edc","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4c0ea","58942e28edc2c965802fa84b","57726dcaedc2cb3880b5060f","59da40beedc2c9ce680d0f55","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ace3","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d6ee","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ebbb","57e416bcedc2cd7734cd5458"]},{"id":"57726da6edc2cb3880b4cc67","artistName":"Jane Frank","url":"jane-frank","lastNameFirst":"Frank Jane","birthDay":"/Date(-1623283200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(517881600000)/","birthDayAsString":"July 25, 1918","deathDayAsString":"May 31, 1986","image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/jane-frank.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Frank","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4e69","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Jane Schenthal Frank was an American artist.

Canova was born in Bologna in 1925, was drafted in 1943 to military service  in the Navy and shortly after he was arrested for attempting to organize a partisan group in La Spezia and interned in a labor camp in the Sudetenland German Brüx .\nAfter the liberation, he studied graphic design in  the Boarding Schools of the “Convitti della Rinascita”, in Rome and Milan. Among his  teachers: Luigi Veronesi, Max Huber, Albe Steiner, Lucio Lombardo Radice, Gabriele Mucchi. After his debut in 1949 in Prague, in an exhibition of Italian graphics and after having been, for some years, the political cartoonist of “L’Unità”, he devoted himself only to  his work as an artist in Rome, the city where he would spend all his life and where he frequented, among others, Mario Mafai, Alberto Ziveri,  Renato Guttuso, Renzo Vespignani, Salvatore Scarpitta, Ugo Attardi, Pier Paolo Pasolini. In 1965 he won the Premio Suzzara and participated in the Quadrennial of Rome, where his work was noticed by Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti, who wrote him  a letter of great appreciation. In this period he develops a research on the city and its suburbs, and  composes spreadsheets and drawings in black and white with a few chromatic  elements in an assembly close to the experiences of historical avant-gardes. Draftsman and engraver of great quality, in the early eighties his path opens onto color and to a painting where the memory of the Roman School merges his analytical vision with the suggestions of the Northern Renaissance in a search which lasted until the last day. Marked as he was by his dramatic war experiences, from 1966 Bruno Canova worked continuously in the exhibition \"The Art of War\" that was exposed in public spaces in many Italian cities, with works where drawing and painting merge documents, newspapers and vintage posters, on  the wake of the Dadaist collage and the outcomes are often close to certain conceptual experiences. Among his many exhibitions,  we must remember his solo shows at the Villa Pignatelli in Naples (1975), at the Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara (1976), at the National Central Library of Rome (1993) and in the Museum of Roman Laboratory of the University \"La Sapienza\" (1998 ), at the Quadrennial in Rome in 1965 and 1986,  and the participation in the Italian Pavilion, section Lazio, 54th  Venice Biennale at the Palazzo Venezia in Rome. He died in Lacco Ameno ( Ischia ) July 31, 2012.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Bruno Canova","relatedArtists":["5a85023bedc2c9584c46dc78","57fb80e8edc2c95dd085c44c","57726de8edc2cb3880b53578","58e5865eedc2c98c788f5455","57726db2edc2cb3880b4e025","5a8e0d62edc2c976347197f9","581132e6edc2c93778e8d77d","57991d2aedc2c905e02a156e","57726debedc2cb3880b53a07","58d92d6eedc2cf82e062f427","599125ebedc2c96e748fc498","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a1c5","5a337af4edc2c93c9c9d7fc0","5beade5cedc2c920c8b0a7f1","57726dacedc2cb3880b4d57e","57726d98edc2cb3880b4b3e3","5bd06f05edc2c92138b5cf8a","57726d8bedc2cb3880b49b4c","57726daaedc2cb3880b4d35d","57726deeedc2cb3880b53e05"]},{"id":"587fe829edc2c98c2844204d","artistName":"George Ault","url":"george-ault","lastNameFirst":"Ault George","birthDay":"/Date(-2468534400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-662860800000)/","birthDayAsString":"October 11, 1891","deathDayAsString":"December 30, 1948","image":"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/00123/images/george-ault/ault.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ault","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e39","57726a66edc2ca38801d4cf1"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["57726d7fedc2cb3880b48109","57726db9edc2cb3880b4ea39","57726dc7edc2cb3880b5015a","57726dcfedc2cb3880b50eba","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51f37","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ec43","57726dddedc2cb3880b52465","57726d86edc2cb3880b49037","5a3aa8faedc2c9343474e982","58dcc2e4edc2c910986e1edc","57726e06edc2cb3880b563b1","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bee3","57726dcfedc2cb3880b50eba","57726db9edc2cb3880b4ea39","57726d8aedc2cb3880b4995d","5a7a3476edc2c9948c89201d","57726df4edc2cb3880b547de","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d457","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a21d","59f24419edc2c98860993b48"]},{"id":"58886936edc2c97d80654e63","artistName":"Siah Armajani","url":"siah-armajani","lastNameFirst":"Armajani Siah","birthDay":"/Date(-978307200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1939","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00116/images/siah-armajani/sdf-1.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siah_Armajani","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f61","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7320"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"58e7554eedc2c97670100000","title":"Fallujah 2004-2005"},{"id":"58e75a4bedc2c97670100000","title":"Tombs"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Siavash Armajani was born in 1939 in Tehran. In 1960, Armajani immigrated to the United States to attend college, as he had family living in the US.\nSiah Armajani designed the Olympic Torch presiding over the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He has worked on other projects such as the New York Staten Island tower and bridge, the Round Gazebo in Nice, France, and the Irene Hixon Whitney Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.\nHis 2005 work, Fallujah, is a modern take on Picasso's Guernica but has been censored in the U.S. due to its critical view of the war in Iraq.\nOne of Armajani's important projects is located at North Shore Esplanade at St. George's Ferry Terminal, Staten Island, NY. Armajani has said:\n\"All buildings and all streets are ornaments. Moreover, the lighthouse and bridge gives a place to the representational arts of poetry, music, and performing. By embracing all of the arts, the lighthouse and bridge asserts its own perspective everywhere.\"\nIn 2010, he won a Knight Fellow award granted by United States Artists.\nAn exhibition at Muelensteen Gallery in 2011 presented a dozen of Armajani's early pieces created in the years leading up to his arrival in America. Many employ ink or watercolor on cloth or paper, and incorporate text. In his \"Shirt\" (1958), Armajani uses pencil and ink to completely cover his father's shirt in Persian script.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"سیاوش

Witz has had one of the most sustained careers of any street artist. He is perhaps known best for his witty, trompe l’oeil stickers and silkscreen paste-up posters, such as “Holes” (1996-99), a series of pieces he pasted around Brooklyn that suggested holes in their respective surfaces. In recent years Witz has turned to painting, mining the city of New York for inspiration and combining traditional and digital tools in his intensive processes. He begins with digital photographs, edits them in Photoshop, and then prints the images onto canvas as achromatic underpaintings. Like the Dutch masters, Witz then applies color with traditional glazing techniques, allowing him to create illusions of depth, form, light, and shadow, as in Big Mosh Pit (2007), for which he drew on his experiences as a musician in the 1980s for subject matter.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Dan Witz","relatedArtists":["57726dc5edc2cb3880b4fd6f","57726dc0edc2cb3880b4f5fb","57726defedc2cb3880b53fa6","57726da7edc2cb3880b4ce86","58f4ee7cedc2c90ffc3690a3","57726defedc2cb3880b5409b","5a357ef6edc2c90f18dbfb0c","58d92d6eedc2cf82e062f427","592ba050edc2c922acf77c2b","5ac8f4baedc2c9d01803d212","580bbc4aedc2c9a2b4e0b981","5a7b00f3edc2c9367c888e18","57726defedc2cb3880b540b2","57eb3f1fedc2c9a45889e1e1","5b4e0ad8edc2c9262c943852","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bd9f","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c8bc","57726defedc2cb3880b53f78","57726defedc2cb3880b53ff6","59a1f129edc2c99d7055bb41"]},{"id":"59cd9a93edc2c9b29c521b50","artistName":"Enrico Caruso","url":"enrico-caruso","lastNameFirst":"Caruso Enrico","birthDay":"/Date(-3056227200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-1527897600000)/","birthDayAsString":"February 25, 1873","deathDayAsString":"August 2, 1921","image":"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/00151/images//pa60m162-504.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Caruso","dictionaries":["57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e28","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d0","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f00"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"59db4a5eedc2c9f0101172e3","artistName":"Manoucher Yektai","url":"manoucher-yektai","lastNameFirst":"Yektai Manoucher","birthDay":"/Date(-1515628800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"December 22, 1921","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00153/images/manoucher-yektai/bigmyektai-2-jpg.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manoucher_Yektai","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4e69","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7320","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Born in Tehran, Iran, Yektai dropped out of the Fine Arts Faculty of Tehran University without obtaining degree.

She was introduced to plein-air painting by the Limerick-born artist Norman Garstin (1847-1926). The artist began exhibiting her work in London and in Ireland in the 1890s and was elected an associate of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1896, becoming a member in 1937.

Kiarostami was an Iranian film director, screenwriter, photographer and film producer. An active film-maker from 1970, Kiarostami had been involved in over forty films, including shorts and documentaries. Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the Koker trilogy (1987–94), Close-Up (1990), Taste of Cherry (1997) – which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year – and The Wind Will Carry Us (1999). In his later works, Certified Copy (2010) and Like Someone in Love (2012), he filmed for the first time outside Iran: in Italy and Japan, respectively.\nKiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter, film editor, art director and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material. He was also a poet, photographer, painter, illustrator, and graphic designer.\nKiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists, for documentary-style narrative films, for stories that take place in rural villages, and for conversations that unfold inside cars, using stationary mounted cameras. He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"عباس

Kasiulis’ great potential for future artistic success was spotted while he was still in Kaunas: Following his first solo exhibition in the Vytautas the Great Museum of Culture in 1943, culture critic Juozas Keliuotis, writing for the Kūryba magazine, was predicting him an outstanding artistic future, and the placement in the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna he had secured was already paving the way to success.\nThe fate of the artist who had left for Austria and Germany in 1944 to refine his skills was determined by the end of WWII, which made it impossible for him to return to Lithuania. Along with other artists that fled Lithuania, Kasiulis taught in the Freiburg School of Arts and Crafts founded in 1946. There he painted prodigiously, participating in exhibitions of Lithuanian artists and organising several solo exhibitions in Kiel, Bad Segeberg, Hamburg, and Freiburg.\nA new and challenging period in the artist’s life began in Paris, where he arrived in 1948. Despite the life of a homeless street wanderer he has experienced in the post-war Paris and miserable lot of a night watchman in a shop, he never lost hope, creating prodigiously, visiting exhibitions, and relentlessly pursuing his goal. Recognition and fame were not long in the coming. Kasiulis’s painting ‘Flight into Egypt’ was included in the list of the best works in the contest organised in Paris by Hallmark, an American gallery, and, along with works by other forty-nine painters, travelled around America’s and Argentina’s most prestigious galleries. Encouraged by his first success, Kasiulis went on to do a solo exhibition in Paris in 1949, which drew the attention of both art critics and gallery owners. Later that same year, Raymond Duncan presented Kasiulis’s works in his own gallery, which brought great fame to the artist. Kasiulis’s works attracted the interest of Marlborough gallery in London, with which he later concluded a long-term agreement. In 1950, famous Parisian art expert Christian-Gilbert Stiébel hosted a large-scale exhibition of works by Kasiulis, which was not only acclaimed by critics but also noticed by museums. In 1955, his works featured in an exhibition of one hundred most famous Parisian artists hosted by the Galliéra Museum. Exhibitions in the most prestigious galleries and museums in Paris soon brought him international acclaim: be it New York, Berlin, Stockholm, Copenhagen, or Geneva, success never left him.\nKasiulis bought a gallery for himself in central Paris, where he exhibited his paintings and graphic works. In Lithuania, however, Kasiulis was hardly ever mentioned simply because his works had been inaccessible for the general public for quite a while.

His work operates in the gap between visual art, the political and painting. And between an problematization of identity and a structuring of conditions. Erik Sigerud is a visual artist that lives and works in Stockholm, Sweden.\nSigerud grew up in Västerås and in Falun, in Sweden. He graduated from The École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris with a Master of Fine Arts in 2004. He did a student exchange with the Berlin University of the Arts in 2003. Sigerud also studied critical theory, philosophy, philosophy of art, creative research processes and other visual artist related studies. Erik Sigerud exhibits in solo and group exhibitions throughout Sweden and abroad. Also, his work is in private and public collections. Erik Sigerud is the recipient of many awards and honours.\n\nErik Sigerud is a visual artist that paints rooms that make up a public sphere. Geometric models of explanation, abstract life energies and images of people collide. The work has a political side. Dialectic encounters between conflicting perspectives on reality aim at expanding on ruling norms. Personal stories encounter deconstructions collective understandings. Political commitments encounter explorations in painting.\n\nSigerud takes interest in critical and dialectical approaches towards information. The paintings deal with the difference between appearance and meaning. The work problematizes depictions of society, relationships, and reality.\n\nA goal is to contribute to a discussion about painting, art and society. Sigerud paints contemporary contexts without making the paintings depend on the same contexts. The paintings will have to manage without a backstory or a press release.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Erik

Schatz [/b] (Shlomo – Zalman Dov Baruch) was born in Lithuania in 1866 to a religious family with a rabbinical lineage. With his special talents he was meant to continue the family dynasty and was sent to Vilna to study in yeshiva (Talmudic college). But Boris was quizzical and had a desire for experience, and religious studies were not suitable for him. [From the autobiography: “…as much as I tried not to think about things that cause one to sin, they still crept into my mind… from that time on I began drawing and loving human portraits, in which I find also today the most interesting material for art…”] He moved to Warsaw where he began his life as an artist and created his first sculpture “Hendel” which perpetuates the Jewish peddler.\nIn 1889 he married Jennie, his first wife, and together they went to Paris. Schatz studied with the sculptor Mark Antokolski, and at the same time studied painting in the Cormorn Academy. He earned a living through random jobs and also engaged in boxing and wrestling. In 1894 he sculpted his famous sculpture “Mattithyahu HaHashmonai” and started gaining recognition as an artist.\nFollowing Prince Ferdinand inviting him to be the court sculptor of the Bulgarian Kingdom, Boris transferred his residence to Bulgaria and founded the Royal Academy of Art in Sofia. After the move to Bulgaria his marital life ended in divorce and separation from his wife Jennie and their daughter Angela. The disappointment from the dissolution of his marriage accelerated his uprooting from Bulgaria. In 1903 he met Binyamin Zeev Hertzel and presented him with the idea of founding a Talmudic college for art-crafts, that would be called “Bezalel” after Bezalel Ben Uri Ben Hur, from the tribe of Yehuda (the first artist mentioned in the bible). The decision to found this establishment was accepted in the Seventh Zionist Congress in Basil.\nIn 1906 Boris Schatz arrived in Israel and founded “Bezalel” which began operating with a fabrics and carpets department. Departments for silver design, brass work, wicker furniture, lithographs and others were gradually added, 30 different handicrafts in total. At a certain point such a broad variety of works were made that they could be displayed in exhibits, and a small museum could be opened in the school. This museum became the basis for the Israel Museum.\nIn 1909 Boris Shatz began presenting “Bezalel” exhibits all over the world for commercial and publicity purposes in order to acquire supporters and donors who would buy the schools products and in that fashion contribute to its development. The school prospered, social life and art works were created in it, as were ideas that served as a founding stone for the revival of a renewing Hebrew culture in Israel.\nIn 1911 he married Dr. Olga Pavzner, an art critic 15 years younger than him. A year later their first son was born, Bezalel Schatz, and four years later their daughter Zohara Schatz was born. The “Bezalel” school was closed down by the Turks for the first time during the First World War. Professor Schatz was arrested and deported, at first to Syria and then to Zephath.\nWith its reopening after the war the school encountered extreme economic difficulties. Boris Schatz died in 1932 in Colorado, USA while journeying to collect donations for “Bezalel”.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Shlomo Zalman Dov

Starting from the differend (insurmountable conflict) between saying and seeing, Benoît Maire works in an in-between where art and philosophy merge into a practical use where forms spread out and surpass one another. Neither philosophy, nor art, the Aesthetics of differends looks to corrupt classical formats by the experimental use of theory. Born in 1978 in Pessac, Benoît Maire, who is a graduate of the Villa Arson, Nice and of the Sorbonne, Paris 1, did a post-diplôme at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.

February 8, 1969), an American artist, was born in Los Angeles to immigrant Armenian parents. From 1947–1949 he attended the Otis Art Institute, from 1947 to 1950 he also attended the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles, and in 1950 the Chouinard Art Institute. Altoon was a prominent figure in the LA art scene in the 1950s and 1960s. Exhibitions of his work have been held at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Corcoran Gallery, Washington D.C, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, The Baxter Museum, Pasadena, and The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (opened June 2014).\n\nAltoon's work was influenced by the Abstract Expressionism Movement although he is best known for his figurative drawings of the 1960s, with as Leah Ollman describes \"a vocabulary of vaguely figurative, botanical and biological forms that he pursued until his death.\"[2] He was part of the \"Ferus group\" of artists so called for their association to the Ferus Gallery that operated in Los Angeles in 1957–1966.[2] Some of the other artists included in this group are Edward Kienholz, Larry Bell, Robert Irwin, Billy Al Bengston. Cool School documentary film about Altoon and other Ferus Gallery artists, many Ferus artists say John was the most fun and friendliest of all, every where everyone liked him. He could charm anyone.\n\nAltoon, during his Ferus Gallery years, did the Ocean Park series which depicted an area around Venice and Santa Monica beach towns in California.[3] The series was 18 paintings as well some works he did on paper. It had the direct from brain to hand & brush approach he was known for:[4] the abstracting of nature on his canvas by pushing through a spontaneous approach, freehand biomorphic[5] in design giving us his interpretation as a direct rendering of the coastal surroundings.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["57726dbdedc2cb3880b4f0f5","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e175","57726df5edc2cb3880b54a2a","57726dccedc2cb3880b509a7","58146d2aedc2c9998837e379","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f319","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4c0bd","5aa6e12aedc2c9b54040f934","57726dd4edc2cb3880b5159a","57726dc8edc2cb3880b5039f","57726ddeedc2cb3880b52611","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4eebf","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f2a5","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dcf8","57726daeedc2cb3880b4d8f1","57726dd3edc2cb3880b51466","57726dddedc2cb3880b524e7","57726dddedc2cb3880b525bb","57726db2edc2cb3880b4df45","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bd43"]},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a014","artistName":"Antoine Blanchard","url":"antoine-blanchard","lastNameFirst":"Blanchard Antoine","birthDay":"/Date(-1865980800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(587174400000)/","birthDayAsString":"November 15, 1910","deathDayAsString":"August 10, 1988","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/be2bf95d-45c3-4ad2-86d2-e0bd2b5a187a.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Blanchard","dictionaries":["57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e30","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad65e0","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d29"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a018","title":"Arc de Triomphe"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a01a","title":"Boulevard de la Madeleine"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a01c","title":"Boulevard des Capucines"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a01e","title":"Bouquinistes de Notre Dame"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a020","title":"Café de la Paix"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a022","title":"Champs Elysees"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a024","title":"Flower market Madeleine"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a026","title":"Gare de Lest"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a028","title":"Grands Boulevards"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a02a","title":"Notre Dame"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a02c","title":"Place de la Bastiile"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a02e","title":"Place de la Concorde"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a030","title":"Place de la Madeleine"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a032","title":"Place de la Republique"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a034","title":"Porte St. Martin"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a036","title":"Porte St. Denis"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a038","title":"Rue Royal Madeleine"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a03a","title":"Rue Tronchet la Madeleine"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a03c","title":"Theatre des Varietes Large"},{"id":"57726d8dedc2cb3880b4a03e","title":"Theatre du Vaudeville"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Antoine Blanchard (Marcel Masson)","relatedArtists":["5aefb144edc2c9ef30d4f248","57726db9edc2cb3880b4eb2d","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e7ac","57726dceedc2cb3880b50c7b","58a82dacedc2c98a64b13d88","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e7c0","58d8e617edc2c982e0775344","57726de5edc2cb3880b531dd","5a7a3476edc2c9948c89201d","57726dcdedc2cb3880b50a53","57726ddcedc2cb3880b522eb","57726dc8edc2cb3880b5032a","57726da8edc2cb3880b4ceed","57726de4edc2cb3880b53026","57726da0edc2cb3880b4c20e","57726dcbedc2cb3880b50717","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51efe","57726dcaedc2cb3880b506c7","57726d89edc2cb3880b497dd","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e4d9"]},{"id":"57726da5edc2cb3880b4c9a7","artistName":"Bui Xuan Phai","url":"bui-xuan-phai","lastNameFirst":"Xuan Phai Bui","birthDay":"/Date(-1577923200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(567993600000)/","birthDayAsString":"1920","deathDayAsString":"1988","image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/bui-xuan-phai.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bui_Xuan_Phai","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4e69","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d61","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7378"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Bùi Xuân Phái was a Vietnamese painter.

His father, Aristakes Mahokian, was a merchant who demanded that his two daughters and four sons be educated. In 1875, Mahokian began his early education at a local Armenian school where he took an interest in drawing. He later attended the prestigious Sanasarian College in Erzurum, returning to Trabzon after five years of study. During his time spent at Sanasarian, Mahokian learned to paint. He also learned to play the violin and studied music theory. Mahokian's uncle persuaded him to pursue a career in art. In 1891, Mahokian began studies at the Berlin Academy of Arts where he was trained under the directorship of Eugen Bracht and Hans Gude.\r\nMahokian graduated from the academy in 1894 and traveled to the Crimea, where he met with renowned Russian Armenian painter Ivan Aivazovsky in Feodosia. While in Russia, Mahokian painted various scenes of the sea. He returned to his native Trabzon in 1895 and witnessed the Hamidian massacres. He escaped first to Batum and then to Europe where he began exhibiting his art. One of his first exhibitions was in Berlin in 1900. In 1904 Mahokian was accepted into the Berlin Artists' Association. He traveled to Egypt where he exhibited over 150 pieces of his artwork in Alexandria and Cairo. After a brief stop in Denmark, Mahokian went to Italy, settled in Capri and continued painting there. He returned to Germany in 1907 and participated in various exhibitions Berlin, Dusseldorf, and Munich.\r\nHe returned to the Ottoman Empire in 1908 and settled in his hometown of Trabzon. He continued to paint there, but with the start of World War I and the Armenian Genocide, Mahokian moved to Nice, France in 1914, where he remained the rest of his life. He received French citizenship in 1927, two years after being awarded the Legion of Honor. He participated in the Paris Salon in 1921, 1922, and 1927. In 1931 a personal exhibition was held at the Palais de la Méditerranée in Nice which included 65 of his works. He also exhibited his works in Monte Carlo in 1932.\r\nHe received the Legion of Honour with the degree of Chevalier (Knight) in 1925.\r\nIn 1915, in memory of those who died during the Armenian Genocide, Mahokian composed a symphony entitled The Sobbing of Armenia. It was first performed at Monte Carlo in 1918 and then played throughout Europe.\r\nAfter a long illness, Mahokian died on 10 February 1937 in Nice, France at the age of 67.\r\n","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Մախոխյան Վարդան

Masson was born in Balagny-sur-Thérain, Oise, but was brought up in Belgium. He began his study of art at the age of eleven in Brussels, at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts under the guidance of Constant Montald, and later he studied in Paris. He fought for France during World War I and was seriously injured.\r\n\r\nHis early works display an interest in cubism. He later became associated with surrealism, and he was one of the most enthusiastic employers of automatic drawing, making a number of automatic works in pen and ink. Masson would often force himself to work under strict conditions, for example, after long periods of time without food or sleep, or under the influence of drugs. He believed forcing himself into a reduced state of consciousness would help his art be free from rational control, and hence get closer to the workings of his subconscious mind.\r\n\r\nFrom around 1926 he experimented by throwing sand and glue onto canvas and making oil paintings based around the shapes that formed. By the end of the 1920s, however, he was finding automatism rather restricting, and he left the surrealist movement and turned instead to a more structured style, often producing works with a violent or erotic theme, and making a number of paintings in reaction to the Spanish Civil War (he associated once more with the surrealists at the end of the 1930s).\r\n\r\nUnder the German occupation of France during World War II, his work was condemned by the Nazis as degenerate. With the assistance of Varian Fry in Marseille, Masson escaped the Nazi regime on a ship to the French island of Martinique from where he went on to the United States. Upon arrival in New York City, U.S. customs officials inspecting Masson's luggage found a cache of his erotic drawings. Denouncing them as pornographic, they ripped them up before the artist's eyes. Living in New Preston, Connecticut his work became an important influence on American abstract expressionists, such as Jackson Pollock. Following the war, he returned to France and settled in Aix-en-Provence where he painted a number of landscapes.\r\n\r\nMasson drew the cover of the first issue of Georges Bataille's review, Acéphale, in 1936, and participated in all its issues until 1939. His stepbrother, the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, was the last private owner of Gustave Courbet's provocative painting L'Origine du monde (The Origin of the World); Lacan asked Masson to paint a surrealist variant.

He was the founder of Lettrism, an art and literary movement which owed inspiration to Dada and Surrealism.\r\n\r\nBorn into a Jewish family in Botoşani, Isou started his career as an avant-garde art journalist during World War II, shortly after the August 23 coup saw Romania joining the Allies (see Romania during World War II). With the future social psychologist Serge Moscovici, he founded the magazine Da, which was soon after closed down by the authorities. He moved to Paris, having developed many concepts that intended as a total artistic renewing starting from their lower levels. He called himself a Lettriste, a movement of which he was initially the only member (at the age of 16 he had published the Manifesto in 1942) and published a system of Lettrist hypergraphics. Others soon joined him, and the movement continues to grow, albeit at times under a confusing number of different names.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s Lettrist, Lettrist-influenced works and Isidore Isou gained a great deal of respect in France. The influential writer Guy Debord and the artist Gil J. Wolman worked with Isou for a while, before breaking away to form the Lettrist International, which latter merged with the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, and the London Psychogeographical Association to form the Situationist International, a dissident revolutionary group. This is how Lettrist art influenced the posters, barricades, even clothing in the attempted revolution of 1968. Although it seemed a highly self-contained art in the post-war period, in 1968 it suddenly became more deeply involved in active social change than such movements as Existentialism and Surrealism, and came closer to producing actual transformation than these movements.\r\n\r\nIsou's final public appearance was at the University of Paris on October 21, 2000. Crippled by ill health, he remained house-bound until his death in 2007. Many of his works, and those of the other Lettrists, have recently been reprinted in new editions, together with much hitherto unpublished material, most notably Isou's very large La Créatique ou la Novatique (1941-1976) (1,390 pages).\r\n\r\nIn July 2007, Kino International released a DVD collection Avant-Garde 2: Experimental Films 1928-1954 which included Isou's film Traité de Bave et d'Èternité (Venom and Eternity) (1951).

In 1977 he returned as Artist in Residence. In the same year he became the first recipient of the Stanley Picker Fellowship Award. He completed a MA postgraduate in Fine Art at Chelsea School of Art under the  artist John Hoyland.\n\nEarly recognition during 1970-1980 included Stowells Trophy at the Royal Academy, Stanley Picker Fellowship Award, Artscribe Prize and Gulbenkian Award.\n\nExhibitions both north and south of the Irish border were unusual at the time due to the troubles, but his pure and authentic style and interpretation proved popular throughout. Henderson's work has been represented at numerous exhibitions in the United Kingdom and USA.\n\nIn the early years, virtually penniless he lived inside a tent in a vast defunct brewery in London's East End. In the 1990's he returned to Ireland with his partner Patricia Martinelli, whom he later married in 1995 and had a daughter in 1997. They remained together until his death.\n\nHenderson created a unique set of enamel art works for the Clinton Peace Centre, inaugurated by President Bill Clinton in 2002. Henderson was influenced by his formative years and the troubles of the region at that time. Though dedicated to his work and never courting public attention his works were noticed by both public and official figures, with works being purchased by collectors such as the rock singer Bono, Northern Ireland Civil Service and Smurfit Kapa Plc.\n\nThroughout his career Jeremy Henderson created numerous series of art works reflecting his interpretation of the landscape around him, always fired by his passion for life and its natural integrity. Dedicated to his art Henderson continued painting until close to his death, caused by a brain tumour.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Jeremy John Christmas Henderson","relatedArtists":["57726dbcedc2cb3880b4f016","57726de8edc2cb3880b53612","580f217dedc2c9826864b08d","57726de3edc2cb3880b52e70","57726da5edc2cb3880b4ca00","58389066edc2c9762c999127","5b229c61edc2c91f5c1009af","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c93d","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c5c1","57726da6edc2cb3880b4cc0e","57726dacedc2cb3880b4d676","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f3e8","57726da3edc2cb3880b4c7b3","5838a380edc2c9762cbcfe1a","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c925","57726dcdedc2cb3880b50a29","5a539ad4edc2c9e57867ba82","57726db1edc2cb3880b4de08","57726dd7edc2cb3880b51a8e","57726dc7edc2cb3880b5018f"]},{"id":"599f130dedc2c963a4196945","artistName":"Antonio Lopez Garcia","url":"antonio-lopez","lastNameFirst":"Lopez Garcia Antonio","birthDay":"/Date(-1072569600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"January 6, 1936","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/00146/images//e167f645240fadc3e56f645b53574fe1.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_López_Garc%C3%ADa","dictionaries":["57726a68edc2ca38801d4fc1","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e21","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7208"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Antonio López García is the eldest son of a married couple of well-to-do farmers in the Castilian town of Tomelloso, La Mancha, and his house was located on Domecq Street. His early vocation for drawing, as well as the influence of his uncle, the painter Antonio López Torres, made up his decision to devote himself to painting.\n\nIn 1949 he moved to Madrid to prepare for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts in San Fernando, where he coincided with various artists such as Enrique Gran, Amalia Avia, and Lucio Muñoz, with whom he formed what has come to be called the Madrid School. He remained in the academy between 1950 and 1955. In 1955, thanks to a scholarship, he traveled to Italy, where he first encountered Italian Renaissance painting. He thus suffered a small disappointment in contemplating live the masterpieces that he only knew by reproductions, and that until that moment he venerated. He began to revalue classical Spanish painting, which he knew so well, thanks to frequent visits to the Prado Museum, especially Diego Velázquez.\n\nAfter completing his studies, he made his first individual exhibitions in 1957 and 1961 in Madrid, while working in this city as well as in the town where he was born. In 1961 he married the painter María Moreno, a union from which two daughters were born: María in 1962 and Carmen in 1965. From this last year and until 1969 he was professor in charge of the Chair of color preparatory in the School of Fine Arts of San Fernando.\n\nIn 1990 the film director Victor Erice filmed El sol del membrillo, a film in which the artist's creative process is collected while painting a quince-keeper from the patio of his house. In January 1993 he was appointed member of the Madrid Royal Academy of San Fernando and in that same year, the Reina Sofía Museum dedicated an anthological exhibition.\n\nIn 2008, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts dedicated a monographic exhibition.1 In addition, his work Madrid from Torres Blancas reached at an auction of Christie's of London the 1,918,000 £, the largest amount paid so far for a work Of a living Spanish artist.2\n\nIn 2011 the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts in Bilbao dedicated temporary exhibitions with works of all stages, but mostly of their latest production.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Antonio Lopez Garcia","relatedArtists":["57726ddcedc2cb3880b52331","57726dd6edc2cb3880b5187b","57726dc3edc2cb3880b4fb0a","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f8ac","57726df7edc2cb3880b54bf0","582d7f53edc2c971289b9eb1","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cd75","57726d94edc2cb3880b4acb4","57726dd4edc2cb3880b515b0","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a2a7","582c338eedc2c999a4adb746","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f532","57726dd2edc2cb3880b51205","5bd06f05edc2c92138b5cf8a","57726d95edc2cb3880b4af03","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e4ad","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a815","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f7c5","57726db9edc2cb3880b4ea25","57726dfdedc2cb3880b5556b"]},{"id":"59b0e214edc2c922c86292d3","artistName":"Vlady","url":"vlady-kibalchich-rusakov","lastNameFirst":"Vlady","birthDay":"/Date(-1563580800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1121904000000)/","birthDayAsString":"June 15, 1920","deathDayAsString":"July 21, 2005","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00148/images//dsc-2015.JPG!Portrait.JPG","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlady_Kibalchich_Rusakov","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d61","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e48","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad66b8","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7250","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e59","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6eb0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1943,"activeYearsCompletion":2004,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Vladímir Kibálchich Rusakov","relatedArtists":["57726d83edc2cb3880b4896b","57726d88edc2cb3880b4947f","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4ba70","57726dfcedc2cb3880b55439","57726dededc2cb3880b53cf1","57726de5edc2cb3880b5314d","59bf10c3edc2c9bb64e743b1","57726de1edc2cb3880b52ad3","57726e09edc2cb3880b582e1","57726dfaedc2cb3880b550bb","57726da5edc2cb3880b4c9a7","5bd003adedc2c92138a0d081","58062f85edc2cd6c3c9595ba","57726db1edc2cb3880b4dd68","57726d8dedc2cb3880b49fe2","57726d83edc2cb3880b4896b","57726d88edc2cb3880b4947f","57726dededc2cb3880b53d1f","57726dfaedc2cb3880b55154","57726dededc2cb3880b53dba"]},{"id":"59bf10c3edc2c9bb64e743b1","artistName":"George Tooker","url":"george-tooker","lastNameFirst":"Tooker George","birthDay":"/Date(-1559174400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1301184000000)/","birthDayAsString":"August 5, 1920","deathDayAsString":"March 27, 2011","image":"https://uploads0.wikiart.org/00153/images/george-tooker/j0002235-1b.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tooker","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e48","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e21","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e09","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1927,"activeYearsCompletion":2011,"biography":"Born in Brooklyn in August 1920, George Tooker grew up in Bellport, a town on the south shore of Long Island. At age seven, he began taking painting lessons with Malcolm Fraser, a professional artist and family friend who had studied at the Académie Julian and École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1938, Tooker graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and, four years later, from Harvard University, where he majored in English literature. He did not take any fine art courses in college, but did have the opportunity to study late medieval and early Renaissance painting for the first time at the Fogg Art Museum and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. \n\nUpon graduating in 1942, Tooker enlisted in the Marine Corps. He entered Officer Candidate School, but was soon discharged for health reasons. Returning to New York, he enrolled at the Art Students League and studied with Reginald Marsh in 1943 and 1944. He also took courses with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Harry Sternberg. While he was a monitor in one of Marsh’s classes, he met Paul Cadmus, who in turn introduced him to Jared and Margaret French, artists who became lifelong friends. Although Tooker had begun to experiment with egg tempera through Marsh, it was Cadmus and French, in particular, who encouraged him to adopt it as his primary medium.  Geroge Tooker continued to paint until his death in 2011.

He was abused both physically and sexually as a child, and was orphaned at the age of 10. He thereafter grew up in a series of state-run foster homes. He worked as a Verdingbub (indentured child labourer) and briefly joined the army, but was later convicted of attempted child molestation, for which he served prison time. After being freed, he was re-arrested for a similar offense and in 1895 was admitted to the Waldau Clinic, a psychiatric hospital in Bern where he spent the rest of his adult life. He was very disturbed and sometimes violent on admission, leading to him being kept in isolation for his early time at hospital. He suffered from psychosis, which led to intense hallucinations.\n\nAt some point after his admission Wölfli began to draw. His first surviving works (a series of 50 pencil drawings) are dated from between 1904 and 1906.\nWalter Morgenthaler, a doctor at the Waldau Clinic, took a particular interest in Wölfli's art and his condition, later publishing Ein Geisteskranker als Künstler (A Psychiatric Patient as Artist) in 1921 which first brought Wölfli to the attention of the art world.\n\nMorgenthaler's book detailed the works of a patient who seemed to have no previous interest in art and developed his talents and skills independently after being committed for a debilitating condition. In this respect, Wölfli was an iconoclast and influenced the development and acceptance of outsider art, Art Brut and its champion Jean Dubuffet.\n\nWölfli produced a huge number of works during his life, often working with the barest of materials and trading smaller works with visitors to the clinic to obtain pencils, paper or other essentials. Morgenthaler closely observed Wölfli's methods, writing in his influential book:\n\n\"Every Monday morning Wölfli is given a new pencil and two large sheets of unprinted newsprint. The pencil is used up in two days; then he has to make do with the stubs he has saved or with whatever he can beg off someone else. He often writes with pieces only five to seven millimetres long and even with the broken-off points of lead, which he handles deftly, holding them between his fingernails. He carefully collects packing paper and any other paper he can get from the guards and patients in his area; otherwise he would run out of paper before the next Sunday night. At Christmas the house gives him a box of coloured pencils, which lasts him two or three weeks at the most.\"\n\nThe images Wölfli produced were complex, intricate and intense. They worked to the very edges of the page with detailed borders. In a manifestation of Wölfli's \"horror vacui\", every empty space was filled with two small holes. Wölfli called the shapes around these holes his \"birds.\"\n\nHis images also incorporated an idiosyncratic musical notation. This notation seemed to start as a purely decorative affair but later developed into real composition which Wölfli would play on a paper trumpet.\n\nIn 1908, he set about creating a semiautobiographical \nepic which eventually stretched to 45 volumes, containing a total of over 25,000 pages and 1,600 illustrations. This work was a mix of elements of his own life blended with fantastical stories of his adventures from which he transformed himself from a child to 'Knight Adolf' to 'Emperor Adolf' and finally to 'St Adolf II'. Text and illustrations formed the narrative, sometimes combining multiple elements on kaleidoscopic pages of music, words and colour.\n\nAfter Wölfli died at Waldau in 1930 his works were taken to the Museum of the Waldau Clinic in Bern. Later the Adolf Wölfli Foundation was formed to preserve his art for future generations. Its collection is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts in Bern.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Adolf Wölfli","relatedArtists":["57726df8edc2cb3880b54db0","57726dddedc2cb3880b525e5","57726dd4edc2cb3880b51502","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51fdd","57726dc8edc2cb3880b50248","57726dededc2cb3880b53cab","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a6aa","57726ddbedc2cb3880b52169","57726dc3edc2cb3880b4faa5","57726dc8edc2cb3880b5022f","57726dc8edc2cb3880b50260","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f868","57726ddcedc2cb3880b52394","57726db0edc2cb3880b4db68","5ba922b6edc2c91ad0e4163c","5ac90a8dedc2c9d018749aed","57726da3edc2cb3880b4c770","5a0a96a2edc2c9e87477ab20"]},{"id":"59da59a3edc2c974203d3ae4","artistName":"Włodzimierz Zakrzewski","url":"wlodzimierz-zakrzewski","lastNameFirst":"Zakrzewski Włodzimierz","birthDay":"/Date(-1704153600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(694224000000)/","birthDayAsString":"1916","deathDayAsString":"1992","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00153/images/wlodzimierz-zakrzewski/zakrzewski-1955-1-3.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82odzimierz_Zakrzewski","dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad7260","57726a66edc2ca38801d4cf1","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e51"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1935,"activeYearsCompletion":1992,"biography":"Włodzimierz Zakrzewski (1916–1992) was a Polish painter, graphician and poster artist.

Sambuu, Zaya, was born in 1975 in a small town called Baatsagaan in the Gobi desert of Mongolia. During his teenage years, the censorship of communism started to fade away, enabling reemergence of forgotten nomadic culture and heritage as well as freedom of religion. And growing nationalism and religious freedom allowed many people to practice Buddhism; and as a teenager who was skilled in drawing, Zaya was greatly encouraged to depict portraits of Buddhist Gods by people who were eager to recover their religious customs and values. Such things had been forbidden by the communist regime for more than four decades. For this reason, Zaya was first introduced to art through Buddhism. Indeed, Buddhism had especially influenced him and at the age of 15 he decided to become a monk. However, after studying Tibetan religious texts for two years, he realized that he had a greater interest in art itself rather than religion. In addition, the lifestyle of the monks and the strict rules of religion clashed with his artistic personality and creativity. At the age of 17, Zaya enrolled in the Soyol Fine Art College in Ulaanbaatar to study traditional Mongolian fine arts. After finishing at the college, he continued to study at the Institute of Fine Art at the Mongolian University of Culture and Art, from which he graduated in 2002. Styles and Techniques Zaya combines the Mongolian traditional painting with contemporary international, especially Asian, influenced art. His unique method of using watercolors, gouache, brush, oil, and mixed medium on canvas allows him to illustrate the ancient traditional customs, and heritage of Mongolian and central Asian nomadic people. Although his works mainly consists of scenes of ancient daily life and exotic portraiture of nature, he connects the spirit of nomadic Mongolian art with Tibetan and Japanese traditional techniques of fine art. By using different methods and studying various cultures, Zaya works to create his own genre that enables him to illustrate a world of antiquity within a modern art. His works, therefore, is neither too traditional, nor modern; rather it is a bridge between the old and the new art. The simplicity of everyday life of nomads and their relationship with the wild nature is one of the main subject matters of his works and they are depicted in his paintings with extraordinarily clear lines and textures, as well as visually strong, often warm yet slight dark, vibrant colors. His paintings contain female figures accompanied by wild beasts or animals such as snow leopards, and wolves, which symbolize the connection of beauty to nature. The female characters, in his paintings, appear majestic and aristocratic and they often represent historic queens and princesses. The images of their costumes and hair styles are carefully studied from the traditional fashions of Mongolian nomadic aristocracy. Zaya writes, \"I believe I may have found the real deity to draw. And that deity is Women. Especially, Mongolia's nomadic women, their close relations with nature, their hard life out on the harsh Mongolian steppe, their unique inner-world, and the customs and traditions they carry on, give me tremendous inspiration and subject matter for most of my work. Through the distinctive features of those Mongolian women's expressions, I try to tell a secret that has never being told, of happiness and misery, of humanity's relations with nature, and of history and contemporary lives and how they connect with us.\" His paintings are also inspired by the history of Mongolia and great Empire of Chinggis khan. The great legacy of his ancestors certainly inspired him personally; thus, a number of his paintings are motivated by and derived from various historical events.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Zayasaikhan Sambuu","relatedArtists":["59884ee5edc2c98edc6a3bd2","57726e04edc2cb3880b560d8","59a4c397edc2c96a1070bb07","58e5865eedc2c98c788f5455","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c4a0","59482570edc2c9a048b9c2fc","58dc1defedc2c9215006f4bd","59d4e7b5edc2c919109f1649","5b35e592edc2c92434f9d709","5b3d37c8edc2c92414cbacf5","57726e06edc2cb3880b5640f","58b2a37aedc2c97404feab53","5a0a96a2edc2c9e87477ab20","57726db1edc2cb3880b4de61","5a85023bedc2c9584c46dc78","5ab0baa1edc2c9ad543bd814","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f4f0","58e7860aedc2cc7670a474de","5be368a7edc2c91e7c81b9ab","5bc73013edc2c9121470dd57"]},{"id":"5a9b426bedc2c968080a7c9e","artistName":"Gustav Adolf Mossa","url":"gustav-adolf-mossa","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(-2743113600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(43977600000)/","birthDayAsString":"January 28, 1883","deathDayAsString":"May 25, 1971","image":"https://uploads0.wikiart.org/00174/images//mossaportrait.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav-Adolf_Mossa","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"A late [b]Symbolist[/b], himself the son of a painter, Mossa admired [b]Moreau[/b].

Born in a Jewish family, she was first married to a banker; second time she was married to the poet Paul Sterian. She attended the painting lessons of Richard Canisius, then, later, of Gore Mircescu. In 1926-29, she studies at Paris. In December 1929-January 1930, she holds her first exhibition at the Mozart Gallery, Bucharest, containing portraits, landscapes and still lives. She is often associated with the Criterion generation, as she had, for instance, a contact with Mircea Eliade. Her first poetry book appears in 1945. New books are released and new exhibitions are held only beginning with the 1960s, after the period in which socialist realism is imposed in Romania. Her artist reputation increases exponentially after her death, as, since 1993, the Margareta Sterian Foundation has prepared numerous retrospective exhibitions, published albums with her paintings and reissued some of her books. Today, her works have prices among the highest paid for a Romanian painter, being considered by some „one of the greatest Romanian painters of the 20th century”.

Crawford was offered a scholarship for the visual arts program at University of the Arts, which he declined in order to pursue his own self-education and personal artistic vision. \n \nCrawford has always had a talent for garnering deep insight about a person from the character or expression of their face – what he calls, “a third thought,” – and this intuitive ability has shaped his perspective of the world and his artwork. Over the course of a decade Crawford developed his NPIC-Art manifesto, in which words are used to share visible and non-visible information. With the knowledge and understanding that a word or image offers more information than face value, NPIC-Art speaks to our desire for interactive information, which is evermore relevant as society craves and devours it in bite-sized and terabyte-sized amounts daily. In NPIC-Art, as the viewer reads and researches the meaning of words incorporated in artworks, they discover a deeper layer of contextual information that informs the work and reveals the artist’s intent. By promoting understanding through research and discovery, NPIC-Art invites viewers to engage with its meaning encouraging more than a singular visual experience. In November 2004 Crawford premiered artworks based on his NPIC-Art manifesto at his official gallery debut as an up-and-coming artist at Qbix Gallery in Philadelphia. \n \nThat same year, Crawford embarked on what would become his decade-spanning Welcome to Earth series inspired by the storytelling structure of traditional theater. Crawford created a four-part experience that revealed his vision over time, collaborating with artists from a variety of creative disciplines to produce events that blurred the line between exhibition and experience. \n \nIn the first exhibition, “Act 01: Human,” Crawford captured what truly makes us human, addressing issues of sin, race, and narcissism. In “Act 02: Dues Ex Machina,” Crawford placed mortality on four paintings and at midnight on the last day of the exhibition, collectors had the opportunity to save the works destined for destruction by purchasing them. By doing what may be considered the unthinkable as an artist, Crawford ignited his free will as a creator and personally engaged with the public. “Act 03: Loovorfook” was an adult art show inspired by the forces that motivate sexuality. Couples at the pre-party exhibition were encouraged to make public declarations and vows of their relationship in front of spectators, and on the opening night a male and female couple in a red-lit gallery window became intimately closer as the night progressed. The final act of the ten-year series, “Act 04: Abracadabra,” was a full sensorial experience with aerialists, performance artists and sound art. Photographs, artwork and commentary of the series have since been published in Welcome to Earth: Rah Crawford’s Art Experience (World Owned, 2016).","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Rah Crawford","relatedArtists":["57726da1edc2cb3880b4c4a0","57726dddedc2cb3880b52519","57726e06edc2cb3880b5640f","59fb5cccedc2c9ab282c1139","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cd27","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cd3d","57726d97edc2cb3880b4b23d","57726d87edc2cb3880b492c2","57726da8edc2cb3880b4cfad","57726dd1edc2cb3880b5108a","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e400","5a55f1fdedc2c98a7c83af22","57726de4edc2cb3880b52fa8","57726dd1edc2cb3880b510ae","57726db8edc2cb3880b4e9ff","57726d8dedc2cb3880b49fac","5a337af4edc2c93c9c9d7fc0","57726deeedc2cb3880b53f23","582d7f53edc2c971289b9eb1"]},{"id":"57726dcaedc2cb3880b5067f","artistName":"Sanyu","url":"sanyu","lastNameFirst":"Sanyu","birthDay":"/Date(-2152742400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-106963200000)/","birthDayAsString":"October 14, 1901","deathDayAsString":"August 12, 1966","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/9190b262-0231-46b4-9542-32e80a1878b1.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanyu_%28painter%29","dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad7290","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad65e0","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"San Yu (Chang Yu; 常玉; 常玉)","relatedArtists":["57726d87edc2cb3880b49265","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a6aa","57726dc8edc2cb3880b502f8","57726df2edc2cb3880b5451a","59f24419edc2c98860993b48","57726dededc2cb3880b53da2","57726dc8edc2cb3880b50310","57726dcfedc2cb3880b50df6","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d46f","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bcc1","57726dc3edc2cb3880b4fbdc","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e4d9","57726d89edc2cb3880b497dd","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51efe","57726df4edc2cb3880b5477e","57726dcbedc2cb3880b50717","57726da0edc2cb3880b4c20e","57726de4edc2cb3880b53026","57726dc8edc2cb3880b5032a","57726d85edc2cb3880b48ea9"]},{"id":"57726de2edc2cb3880b52c8a","artistName":"Phillip King","url":"phillip-king","lastNameFirst":"King Phillip","birthDay":"/Date(-1136073600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1934","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/phillip-king.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_King_%28artist%29","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e8","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f41","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f00"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Phillip King PRA","relatedArtists":["57726deeedc2cb3880b53f0c","57726deeedc2cb3880b53ecc","57726deeedc2cb3880b53ef9","57726deeedc2cb3880b53ee2","57726dc2edc2cb3880b4f99f"]},{"id":"57726da0edc2cb3880b4c16a","artistName":"Lino Tagliapietra","url":"lino-tagliapietra","lastNameFirst":"Tagliapietra Lino","birthDay":"/Date(-1136073600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1934","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/dab5c501-715a-4ed6-bfad-32c532395af2.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lino_Tagliapietra","dictionaries":["57726a68edc2ca38801d4f59","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d0","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f00"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Lino Tagliapietra is an Italian glass artist, with a distinctive, hard-to-classify style that recalls abstract (and especially op) art.\r\n\r\nTagliapietra was born on the island of Murano in 1934. Murano, an island whose history of glass dates back to 1291, provided Tagliapietra an ideal educational environment to develop his techniques and glass artistry. At the age of 12 he was apprenticed by the glass maestro Archimede Seguso. Nine years later, at the age of 21, he earned the rank of maestro.\r\n\r\nFor the next 25 years Tagliapietra worked in association with a number of Murano's top glass factories, including Vetreria Galliano Ferro, Venini & C., La Murrina, Effetre International and EOS Design nel Vetro. His influence on the American art glass studio movement is primarily attributed to his colleague Dale Chihuly. In 1968 Chihuly visited Murano and learned from Tagliapietra, as well as other glass maestri, including Pino Signoretto.\r\n\r\nIn 1979 Tagliapietra travelled to the United States to teach at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. This event marked the beginning of knowledge sharing amongst the American Glass Artists and the Italian maestros, who in the past had guarded their techniques as valuable trade secrets.\r\n\r\nThe 1980s marked Lino's entry into the studio artist world after over a decade of traveling, teaching and working with studio artists worldwide.

Apple (ONZM) is an artist whose work is associated with the New York and British schools of Pop Art in the 1960s and with the Conceptual Art movement in the 1970s. He collaborated with the likes of Andy Warhol and other pop artists. His work is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (New Zealand), Auckland Art Gallery / Toi o Tamaki (New Zealand), the Christchurch Art Gallery / Te Puna o Waiwhetu (New Zealand), The University of Auckland (New Zealand) and the SMAK/Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (Ghent, Belgium).\r\n\r\nBarrie Bates was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1935. He left secondary school with no qualifications and took a job as an assistant to a paint manufacturer in 1951. Bates attended evening classes at Elam School of Fine Arts, where he met Robert Ellis, a graduate of the Royal College of Art in London.\r\n\r\nIn 1959 he left New Zealand on a National Art Gallery scholarship. He studied at the Royal College of Art, London, from 1959 until 1962. During his time at the Royal College of Art, Bates met several other artists who went on to become a new generation of pop artists; including David Hockney, Derek Boshier Frank Bowling and Pauline Boty. He exhibited frequently during his time at the College in the Young Contemporaries and Young Commonwealth Artists exhibitions along with Frank Bowling, Jonathan Kingdon, Bill Culbert, Jan Bensemann and Jerry Pethick.\r\n\r\nIn 1962 Bates conceived Billy Apple: he bleached his hair and eyebrows with Lady Clairol Instant Creme Whip and changed his name to Billy Apple. Apple had his first solo show in 1963 - Apple Sees Red: Live Stills - in London at Victor Musgrave's Gallery One.\r\n\r\nApple moved to New York in 1964: he progressed his artistic career and also found work in various advertising agencies.\r\n\r\nA pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit \"The American Supermarket\", a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it — the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc. — was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, including Billy Apple, Andy Warhol, Tom Wesselmann, Jasper Johns and others.\r\n\r\nApple was one of the artists who pioneered the use of neon in art works (Apples to Xerox and Neon Rainbows). Other exhibitions and series include Art for Sale, The Given as an Art Political Statement, Transactions, Golden Rectangle, The Art Circuit etc.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Apple was the subject of a feature length documentary called \"Being Billy Apple\".

Born at Headingley, Leeds in Yorkshire in 1920, he was the son of Thomas Milner Heron and Eulalie 'Jack' Heron (née Davies), the first of four children (Michael, Joanna and Giles). His father was a clothes manufacturer, pacifist, socialist and leading member of the Leeds Arts Club. He attended St. George's School in Harpenden and on a school visit to the National Gallery, London in 1933 saw paintings by Paul Cézanne for the first time. He immediately began to paint in a Cézanne-influenced style. Shortly after this he was asked to make designs for Cresta Silks and continued to design for Cresta until 1951. When he was 17 he attended The Slade School of Art for two days a week, returning to the West Country to draw the landscape. In World War II he registered as a conscientious objector and worked as an agricultural labourer for three years, then at the Leach Pottery at St Ives in 1944–45, where he met Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and many other leading artists of the St Ives School. He had just seen Matisse's The Red Studio, exhibited at the Redfern Gallery, London and soon after this completed what he later considered to be his first mature work, The Piano in 1943.\r\n\r\nThe George Braque exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1946 deeply impressed him and he wrote an essay on Braque for The New English Weekly. Then up to 1953 he spent time in Europe visiting Paris, Provence and Italy. Heron visited Braque in his Paris studio and presented him with the New English Weekly article. His first one-man exhibition was at the Redfern Gallery in London in 1947. In 1953 he organised, wrote the catalogue and exhibited in Space in Colour, an exhibition of ten contemporary artists, at Hanover Gallery, London. Following this he exhibited twelve paintings at the Il Bienal di São Paulo, Brazil. The same year he began teaching at Central School of Arts and Crafts in London and continued there until 1956. In 1956 he saw, and praised highly the American Abstract Expressionists who showed their work for the first time in England at the Tate Gallery. He was inspired by this group of eight painters, their confidence and the large scale and flatness.\r\n\r\nA development towards abstraction had been evident in his paintings, for example, Square Leaves (1952) and Winter Harbour (1955) The effect on Heron of the New York painters, together with his move to live at Eagles Nest, overlooking the cliffs at Zennor, that year was a pivotal point in the transformation into his now characteristic language of interlinking forms; his balancing of colour and space. Heron's deepest influences were Braque, Matisse and Bonnard and he was connected first of all to the pure abstraction of European lineage, represented by Naum Gabo and Pierre Soulages.\r\n\r\nHe continued painting until the day before he died. He died peacefully at his home in Zennor, Cornwall, on 20 March 1999 at the age of 79. He was survived by both his daughters, Katharine Heron, now an architect, and Susanna Heron, a sculptor.

as the first Puerto Rican artist and founder of the Puerto Rican national school for their colorful . Rivafrecha Joseph and Jordan , better known as José Campeche was born in San Juan de Puerto Rico in the corner of Calle San Sebastian Cruz and the December 23, 1751 . His parents were Thomas and Mary Jordan Campeche Marques and the third of seven children. As a child he liked the drawing and introduces the visual arts under the influence of his father who was engaged in the trade of gilder , carver and adornista .\r\n\r\nCampeche course studies in philosophy and Latin at the Dominican Convent . In addition he studied music as a child which helped his humanist education as an individual. His paintings can be divided into two categories : the portraitist : towards a rich attention to detail and some influence of French Rococo and religious : where used as reference prints of religious figures . We can also fall into two periods : from 1763a1776 years of his development as an artist and from 1776 until his death in 1806 where the influence of the court painter Luis Paret y Alcazar shows.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 the Spanish painter Luis Paret y Alcázar reached Puerto Rico and Campeche (which by then was 25) was found in him a friend and instructor who learn the technique in vogue. Although retained his own style, the work of Campeche this time accused the stylistic influence of the Rococo. When three years later, Paret y Alcazar returned to Spain  , Campeche regained his self-training. Although the artist evolve from this school, the influence of the Rococo in his painting is very evident.\r\n\r\nJosé Campeche distinguished himself with his paintings related to religious themes and of governors and other important personalities. His most famous paintings are the portraits of Juan Alejo de Arizmendi, Ramon de Castro and Miguel A. de Ustariz and The Virgin of Belen,The Virgin of the Rosary, Saint John the Baptist, The Sacred Family, The Bishop of San Francisco de la Cuerda, The Vision of Saint Anthonyand The Shipwreck of Power in honor of Ramon Power y Giralt.\r\n\r\nPuerto Rican society of the time appreciated Campeche's personal and artistic merits and he is now considered to be amongst the most gifted rococo artists in the Americas. His works of art can be found in museums, churches and private collections in Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Campeche died in the city of San Juan on November 7, 1809.\r\n\r\nJosé Campeche is considered by many as one of the best rococo artists in the Americas. According to the American art historian ReneTaylor the largest Spanish-American painter of the eighteenth century and its pictorial legacy is estimated at 400 to 600 works.

In 1955 Heijermans won a scholarship for the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam; there she worked with professor Gé Röling  (1904-1981) and Jan Wiegers. In 1956 she met Nils Tellander, born in Holland, but a volunteer in the British Army during the second world war. They got married in September 1958 and settled in Switzerland in Chailly-Lausanne, where in 1960 their son Anian was born.\r\n\r\nIn 1968 Heijermans entered the American high school Villa Schifanoia in Florence, Italy, the European section of Arts and Sciences in River Forest, illinois USA. Villa Schifanoia stood on the heights of San Domenico di Fiesole. Her etching teacher Swietlan Kraczyna found a studio for her in a Florentine palazzo near Ponte Carraia at the river Arno. In 1972 Heijermans won the Premio Brunellesco (a Florentine prize for painters, sculptors and other artists) with a series of seven oil paintings, honored by Piero Bargellini, the Mayor of Florence. \r\n\r\nIn 1972 Heijermans returned to Villars in Switzerland, taking with her the 200 kilogram etching press from Bendini-Bologna. The couple Tellander divorced in 1973; her husband Nils Tellander remained in Lausanne. He died in 2001 in the South of France. Hubertine Heijermans continued to live and work in the canton Vaud in Switzerland, a Pre-Alp region. There she made many etchings and photo-etchings of the Swiss landscape, Swiss villages, farm-houses, barns and the rural architecture in a rather detailed and recognizable manner, until 1988. Moreover she made many colorful watercolor paintings on paper of the same subject. Hubertine Heijermans never stopped painting with oils, in particular during the winter months spent in Spain from 1996- 2006 and in Bages in the South of France during the year 2006. In Holland she always worked with watercolor or oil paint during the summer, from 1983 until 1999. Her teacher in photo-etching and heliography was the wellknown printmaker Luis Camnitzer from Pratt's Institute, New-York. In Spain she received valuable instruction for watercolor from Jesus Peñarreal.\r\n\r\nThe Museum Jenisch in Vevey, Switzerland keeps over 80 of her etchings and aquatint prints in the 'Cabinet d'Estampes'. The Museum Elysée in Lausanne has 45 of her 'héliogravures à grain'. In Venlo, The Netherlands the museum Bommel-van Dam keeps 23 of her etchings.

He is currently an associate lecturer, and co - founder of Albus 3 Arts, an artist led studio and exhibition organisation.\n\nHis work  investigates the location of painting art practice in relation to the internet, specifically when functionality becomes error.\n\n  \"Mark Sibley and his work are full of questions, questions that there aren’t necessarily answers to, at least as far as I can tell. And yet the questions, like his work, consistently work away at any answers. Out of all the problems a sense of continuity is created, along with the feeling that this continuity itself is perhaps found in a world of unanswerable glitches. Painting thus represented becomes a funny old world born anew, bright and illuminating. He had had a show of his digital paintings in Bletchley Park. Steeped in a kind of museum of preserved thought I would have liked to have seen them there and imagine that their careful immediacy would have served as a bright complementary energy to that pickled and organised 1940s horizon; a resonant experience of conjoined disciplines; of different languages and their dreamings and struggles. This sense of purpose working within larger creative horizons defines the experience of Mark's paintings for me, a sense of history and its opposite, of representation and escape. The matter of factuality of the museum baits a novelistic imaginary response and I can imagine the windmills that we now orbit awkwardly in his studio crystallising there amongst the dusty valves and rough algorithms at the very birthing suite of computing itself. But Mark and his paintings have a knack of reminding me that these are merely my own errant flights of fancy opening onto his endless questions: Is he taking a well-established order and finding his own path, or subverting it slightly? Is it celebratory or slightly mocking or both or neither?\"   ( From Turps Banana article - On Getting Lost:  Phil King, Mark Sibley and\nMark Sibley’s Paintings, by Phil King.)","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Mark Sibley","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f450","artistName":"Kay Nielsen","url":"kay-nielsen","lastNameFirst":"Nielsen Kay","birthDay":"/Date(-2644704000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-395452800000)/","birthDayAsString":"March 12, 1886","deathDayAsString":"June 21, 1957","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/f462949b-a507-4076-8101-2d2144562000.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Nielsen","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d41","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e70"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Kay Rasmus Nielsen ","relatedArtists":["57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a159","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c421","5a4cf1f1edc2c900bce1832d","598362fcedc2c9658c38ed9e","57726df8edc2cb3880b54eae","57726da9edc2cb3880b4d161","57726d94edc2cb3880b4aba1","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f43c","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f47c","57726da8edc2cb3880b4cfd9","57726dffedc2cb3880b557c1","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a4fa","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c408","578621d3edc2cc202cae9b86","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dc60","57726dfdedc2cb3880b55585","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bdcb","57726ddbedc2cb3880b521c8","57726d85edc2cb3880b48f21","58e42b54edc2c99464d1f36f"]},{"id":"590b0758edc2ce2df8acec32","artistName":"Florijan","url":"florijan","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(-609638400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"September 7, 1950","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00130/images//self-portrait-florijan-2010.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":[],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Marjan Floršic","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726da1edc2cb3880b4c451","artistName":"David Smith","url":"david-smith","lastNameFirst":"Smith David","birthDay":"/Date(-2013897600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-145497600000)/","birthDayAsString":"March 9, 1906","deathDayAsString":"May 23, 1965","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/7e50041f-cfc2-4236-8d5b-9d81c6751ef9.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Smith_%28sculptor%29","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4e69","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad6710","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f00"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"David Roland Smith was an American Abstract Expressionist sculptor and painter, best known for creating large steel abstract geometric sculptures.

Took up painting as a teenager while convalescing from an infection that ultimately cost him a leg. Began formal studies in Weimar in 1870. Initially painted large-scale landscapes, working successively through academic, naturalist, Impressionist, and Neo-Impressionist styles. In 1901 left Weimar for Hagen at urging of collector Karl Ernst Osthaus, who offered him a studio in the modern art museum he was establishing there. Through this exposure to the avant-garde, including meeting Edvard Munch in 1904 and Emil Nolde a year later, and seeing Van Gogh's choppy brushstrokes and vibrant coloring, his work moved into its final, Expressionist phase.\n\nMade first of 185 prints at age sixty, in 1908, after seeing an exhibition of Brücke prints. Aside from two lithographs, worked exclusively in woodcut and linoleum cut. Rarely editioned his work, preferring to create unique or variant impressions by hand-printing his own blocks, which he inked with a brush and then printed through rubbing or by applying pressure from a weighted cigar box. Concentrated mostly on figurative subjects, as well as biblical themes in response to World War I. Stopped making new motifs in 1926, but continued printing new impressions from old blocks.\n\nIn 1937 Nazis expelled him from the Prussian Academy of Arts, condemned him as degenerate, and removed 412 of his works from public collections.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Christian

Bogdanovich Yakulov - Russian painter, avant-garde, graphic artist, stage designer, creator of the \"Theory of Light and the origin of styles in art\" known as the \"Theory of colored suns\".\r\nStudied painting for two years at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. During his military service, spent partly in northeast China, he developed an appreciation of Eastern light effects and decoration. \r\nIn 1907 he began exhibiting with the Moscow Association of Artists, the Union of Russian Artists and Mir Iskusstva, and in Paris and Berlin. He travelled to Italy (1910) and to Paris (1912–1913), where he met Sonia and Robert Delaunay, discovering that his artistic ideas of light corresponded with their theory of Simultanism.\r\nYakulov became a member of the Leftist Federation of Painters, organised the decorative, yet abstract interior design of the Café Pittoresque in Moscow, and participated in decorative preparations for various private balls, spectacles and amateur theatrical events in 1910 and 1911. His career in the theatre began officially in 1918, when he designed the sets for Aleksandr Tairov’s Obmen (The exchange) at the Kamerny Theatre. Yakulov’s subsequent designs for Tairov, Princess Brambilla (1920) and Giroflé-Girofla (1922), combined traditional theatrical techniques with modernist abstraction.\r\nIn 1925 Yakulov returned to Paris to exhibit in the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs, and was commissioned by Diaghilev to design for the Ballets Russes production of Le Pas d’acier, eventually performed in 1927 at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt. He died a year later in Russia, leaving behind unrealised designs for Vsevolod Meyerhold’s play Misteriya-Buff.\r\n\r\n","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Յակուլյան Գևորգ

Hoyland (RA) was a London-based British artist. He was one of the country's leading abstract painters.\r\n\r\nHoyland was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, and educated at Leighton Park School, before going onto study at Sheffield School of Art, Psalter Lane, and the Royal Academy Schools. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1991 and was appointed Professor of the Royal Academy Schools in 1999. The National Portrait Gallery holds portraits of the artist in its collection.\r\n\r\nHoyland's first solo exhibition was held at the Marlborough New London Gallery in 1964 and he had a solo show at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1967. In the 1960s, Hoyland's work was characterised by simple shapes, high-key colour and a flat picture surface. In the 1970s his paintings became more textured. He exhibited at the Waddington Galleries, London throughout the 1970s and 1980s. During the 1960s and 1970s, he showed his paintings in New York City with the Robert Elkon Gallery and the André Emmerich Gallery. His paintings are closely aligned with Post-Painterly Abstraction, Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction. Hoyland disliked the \"abstract\" painter label and described himself as \"a painter\".\r\n\r\nRetrospectives of his paintings have been held at the Serpentine Gallery (1979), the Royal Academy (1999) and Tate St Ives (2006). He won the 1982 John Moores Painting Prize.\r\n\r\nHis works are held in many public and private collections including the Tate. In September 2010, Hoyland and five other British artists including Howard Hodgkin, John Walker, Ian Stephenson, Patrick Caulfield and R.B. Kitaj were included in an exhibition entitled The Independent Eye: Contemporary British Art From the Collection of Samuel and Gabrielle Lurie, at the Yale Center for British Art.

Out of the three, Twombly is probably the lesser known and most enigmatic character. This is partly due to the fact that Twombly seemed to be out of step with the dominant trends of the time. His art was always contemporary and reflective of his time, however his unique style always set him apart from the prevailing trends. Even though many of Twombly’s artworks are linked to styles and movements, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism#!#resultType:masonry]Abstract Expressionism[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neo-dada#!#resultType:masonry]Neo-Dada[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/minimalism#!#resultType:masonry]Minimalism[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/conceptual-art#!#resultType:masonry]Conceptual Art[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neo-expressionism#!#resultType:masonry]Neo-Expressionism[/url], none of these categories fully describes the diversity and richness of his body of work.\n\nTwombly showed an interest in painting from an early age. After receiving a scholarship in 1950, he moved to New York to pursue his studies and painting career. There, he became acquainted with Rauschenberg and Johns, and through the early 1950s he began to develop his artistic style. For Twombly, the past was the source of energy that inspired the creation of contemporary art. It began with an interest in ‘primitive art’, archeology and ancient artifacts, and deepened when he travelled to Europe and North Africa with Rauschenberg in 1952. He was particularly taken by Italy, and in 1957 he moved to Rome. In Rome, the artist gained the freedom that allowed him to break away from the influence of New York art circles. Following his move to Italy, the artist introduced color to his work, and created canvases inspired by Roman and Italian culture, in particular by mythology, historical events and famous masterpieces. He was inspired by Rome as an intersection of ancient classical culture, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/high-renaissance#!#resultType:masonry]Renaissance[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque#!#resultType:masonry]Baroque[/url] heritage, and contemporary urban life. Twombly was able to harness this energy by mixing influences of mythology, history and graffiti on local ancient walls. At the same time, his paintings were original interpretations of culture and history that expressed his individuality and contemporary artistic sensibility.\n   \nFrom the mid-1960s, Twombly began to paint series of gray-ground paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/cy-twombly/cold-stream][i]Cold Stream[/i][/url] (1966), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/cy-twombly/untitled-1967][i]Untitled[/i][/url] (1967), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/cy-twombly/untitled-16][i]Untitled[/i][/url] (1970), which were stylistically minimalist and focused on the gesture of painting. These paintings, often called ‘blackboard paintings’ had repeating rows of white circular lines. The line is reminiscent of handwriting, and evokes the idea of writing in an abstract manner. This was reflective of another important feature in Twombly’s art, who throughout his career used writing and text in his art. He was interested in graffiti, and often incorporated words, text and poetry into his paintings.

He lived, breathed, wrote, created, and celebrated art, both on and off of the ballet stage. As an artist, Benois was not as prolific as a painter for the sake of painting or creating, but rather as a method of ballet set and stage design. He began his career at the Mariinsky Theatre as a scenic designer, and quickly expanded his role to be at the forefront of ballet set and costume design. His most famous production was Petrushka, in 1911, a production in which he also co-wrote the libretto with composer Igor Stravinsky. \r\n\r\nBenois was a founding member of the “World of Art” group, a collection of the artists and art critics of the day, and contributed to the group’s expositions and magazine on a regular basis. As such, Benois was much more than a painter. He was also an art director, ballet librettist, museum curator, art critic, historian, and preservationist. It is perhaps in this vein that he was able to acquire Leonardo da Vinci’s “Madonna,” which he donated to the Hermitage Museum. This painting was later referred to as “Madonna Benois.” \r\n\r\nTo escape the violence of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Benois devoted his time to the study of art in periods of Russian history. He also became a specialist on ancien-regime French art. In his writings, he stressed individualism and artistic personality, and wanted to combine Western European trends in art with Russian Folk art. Many of his paintings are illustrations of scenic decorations and set designs for ballets, and as such are not as technically accurate as they are emotionally charged and colorful. Many of his works evince a dreamlike quality, in which the viewer can mentally envision setting foot on stage. Benois produced over 100 writings on topics ranging from art history to his Memoirs, and worked on over 200 ballet productions world wide. He is now considered one of the creators of modern ballet.

Nonetheless, Lama's poems are often compared to those by humanist poet Francesco Petrarch, and she possessed ample knowledge of mathematics and a passion for philosophical studies. Although very little documentation survives about her life and works, scholars have uncovered a treasure trove: 200 of her drawings featuring both male and female nudes. She is said to have been trained by her father, Agostino Lama, before studying alongside Giambattista Piazzetta (1682-1754), a rococo painter and her childhood friend. While Lama's paintings are similar to Piazzetta's in their sharp contrasts of light and shade, her technique is said to surpass his.

He had a tumultuous youth and spent much time in and out of reform schools and prisons.\n\nDuring these confinements he always painted.  No matter in which prison he spent time, he was provided with canvas and paints and, of course, plenty of time.  He would search the prison library to find books or magazines on art and would leaf through them into the early hours of the morning.  At Auburn, the other prisoners encouraged him to paint, and later he taught art to his fellow inmates.  By the time he was paroled, there was a waiting list to attend his classes.\n\nJohnson's turning point came in 1977 when a New York television station was sent to cover a group show at the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Art and Cultural Center in Brooklyn, and they singled him out for a special segment. It was through that broadcast that Felicie, and her husband, the retired president of the Knoedler Gallery, spotted Johnson's talent and signed him on.  Together, they arranged his first exhibition to be held at the prestigious Wildenstein Gallery in New York City.\n\nOver the years, Felicie arranged exhibitions for his work at art galleries throughout the United States, along with the many exhibitions at Gallery Felicie, itself. The most exciting and widely publicized of all Johnson's exhibits were one on JAZZ, and another, on CATS.\n\nOliver Johnson has developed his own style.  He is an excellent draftsman.  Whatever his subject may be, his talent is seen in his striking oil paintings and in his pastels and drawings as well.  He has a keen sense of volume, line, and the relationship of color.\n\nToday, Johnson's art work hangs in major collections in the United States and Europe.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Oliver Johnson","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726db1edc2cb3880b4dd80","artistName":"Albert Huie","url":"albert-huie","lastNameFirst":"Huie Albert","birthDay":"/Date(-1546387200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1264896000000)/","birthDayAsString":"December 31, 1920","deathDayAsString":"January 31, 2010","image":"https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/albert-huie.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Huie","dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad73d0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d31"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Albert Huie","relatedArtists":["57726dafedc2cb3880b4d9c8","59309d14edc2c979d4e9ab7b","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aace","57726debedc2cb3880b538cc","57726db8edc2cb3880b4e92a","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e54a","57726de5edc2cb3880b530db","59338f56edc2c917708da9b8","57726db9edc2cb3880b4eab9","57726da3edc2cb3880b4c802","57726da3edc2cb3880b4c7f6","58d8e617edc2c982e0775344","588316aeedc2c97a04881e86","57726df8edc2cb3880b54e07","58dbbf01edc2c958ec98c0ce","57726e06edc2cb3880b564b7","57726df5edc2cb3880b54951","57726dd2edc2cb3880b51260","57726dd5edc2cb3880b5169f","57726dc9edc2cb3880b5045d"]},{"id":"57726de4edc2cb3880b52f36","artistName":"Marino Marini","url":"marino-marini","lastNameFirst":"Marini Marino","birthDay":"/Date(-2172528000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(334368000000)/","birthDayAsString":"February 27, 1901","deathDayAsString":"August 6, 1980","image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/marino-marini.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marino_Marini_%28sculptor%29","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d61","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d0","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f00"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Marino Marini","relatedArtists":["57726d87edc2cb3880b49265","57726df2edc2cb3880b5451a","57726db4edc2cb3880b4e222","57726dd4edc2cb3880b515de","57726d9bedc2cb3880b4b991","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e1d7","57726dc2edc2cb3880b4fa07","57726dafedc2cb3880b4dade","58d136b3edc2c94f9092e6be","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4ba70","59f24419edc2c98860993b48","57726dd5edc2cb3880b51705","57726df5edc2cb3880b54951","57726dc6edc2cb3880b4ff7f","58719b8eedc2c949a4520cd2","5a15c3bbedc2c9efd0bc1466","57726de4edc2cb3880b52f0a","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4ba1f","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c88c","588cb121edc2c997d89810bb"]},{"id":"57726dbcedc2cb3880b4efe1","artistName":"Taras Shevchenko","url":"taras-shevchenko","lastNameFirst":"Shevchenko Taras","birthDay":"/Date(-4917110400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-3433795200000)/","birthDayAsString":"March 9, 1814","deathDayAsString":"March 10, 1861","image":"https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/taras-shevchenko/self-portrait-1841.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko","dictionaries":["57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce9","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71f0","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7200"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1826,"activeYearsCompletion":1861,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Тарас Шевченко","relatedArtists":["58942e28edc2c965802fa84b","57726daaedc2cb3880b4d252","57726e04edc2cb3880b560ee","5846f0efedc2c9968cb3c94c","57726d8cedc2cb3880b49df0","57726dd4edc2cb3880b514c2","5a0b6dcaedc2c9c0b0e3e851","59b13a8eedc2c922c8ad547f","57726dffedc2cb3880b55829","57726d96edc2cb3880b4b03a","57726dfeedc2cb3880b556d4","57726e02edc2cb3880b55dc8","57726d80edc2cb3880b48261","57726e01edc2cb3880b55c2a","57726e09edc2cb3880b582f5","57726dfeedc2cb3880b555fe","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f8c4","57726ddfedc2cb3880b527cf","57726dc4edc2cb3880b4fc44","57726e00edc2cb3880b55b99"]},{"id":"57726da6edc2cb3880b4cb79","artistName":"Theodor Aman","url":"theodor-aman","lastNameFirst":"Aman Theodor","birthDay":"/Date(-4379702400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-2473113600000)/","birthDayAsString":"March 20, 1831","deathDayAsString":"August 19, 1891","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/00cee6d0-561a-4e5b-b33d-35012f76983f.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Aman","dictionaries":["57726a66edc2ca38801d4cc9","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e68","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0","57726b50edc2cb3880ad72a0","57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Theodor Aman was one of the most important Romanian painters of the XIXth century. His works blend Romanticism and Academicism, as well as bearing characteristics of early/Pre-Impressionism. He took drawing lessons with the painter Constantin Lecca, at Central School in Craiova, and in 1850 he leaves for Paris. Here, he studies painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, under the supervision of Michel Martin Drolling and François Edouard Picot. He returns to Romania in 1857, already established as a painter. His workshop becomes one of the most popular meeting places of high society,  „the only artistic center of Bucharest's elite of that time“. His contribution to Romanian art transcends his work, by his important contribution to the establishment of the first Fine Arts School in Bucharest (1864), where he was both the first teacher and the director.\r\n\r\nThe thematics approached by Theodor Aman in his works - historical painting, gender and Oriental scenes, scenery, still nature - are distinctly represented in the exhibition, through works of important heritage value. The techniques employed by Theodor Aman range from easel painting, engraving and drawing. Moreover, his works range from large scale painting (particularly heroic representations of the past and historical portraits) and small scale works (contemporary or daily life projects).

Berkowitz studied at the University of Pennsylvania, the Art Students League in New York, and in Paris, Florence, and Mexico City. During World War II he was in the Army, stationed in Virginia, and in 1945, after completing his military service, he moved to Washington, D.C. He painted and taught art for more than ten years in D.C. high schools and later, in 1969, at The Corcoran Gallery’s School of Art, where he was chairman of the painting department. He continued to teach there for almost twenty years, until his death in 1987.\r\n\r\nWith his first wife, the poet Ira Fox Berkowitz, Leon Berkowitz established the Washington Workshop Center for the Arts in 1945. This Center became a cultural catalyst in the city, bringing together leaders in both the performing and visual arts, including painters such as Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, and Gene Davis, who would later become well-known founders of the Washington Color School group. The Workshop Center closed in 1956, and Berkowitz and his wife spent much of the next decade traveling and living abroad, primarily in Spain and Wales. It was during this sabbatical from his life in Washington that his painting took a new direction, and it is this late work for which he is best known.\r\n\r\nBy the 1970s, Berkowitz’s paintings had become completely abstract, suffused with mists of color and light. Though he was often associated with the Color School painters, he vigorously denied that connection, asserting instead that his floating washes of color carried light, and through light, a spiritual presence. And, indeed, the intense white ground used to prime his canvases radiates light, creating a luminous, color-drenched atmospheric effect. In a statement for an exhibition of his work at The Phillips Collection in 1976 he said, “I am endeavoring to find that blush of light over light and the color within the light; the depths through which we see when we look into and not at color.” ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Leon

In 1902, after his marriage to Valeria Hmelnitskaya, the young family goes to Rome where Goldstein continues his art education in private studios, creating the first considerable works. In them he acts as artist symbolist.\n\nAfter short-term visit to Russia in 1907, he comes back abroad again where travels to Italy, France, Switzerland, Spain. The majority of time he lives in Germany, in Munich that becomes the original capital of Jugendstil at the turn of the century. During this period Goldstein's works considerably change, opening the way for modernist painting, but, even working in the West European manner, he continues to find out the interest to the Russian plots and motives that pulls together Goldstein with masters of \" World of art\" with that difference that their works, generally were imitation of the European tradition, and Goldstein's painting is an original, Jugendstil's sample. Therefore modern comparison of Goldstein with famous names of Russian \"World of art\" causes confusion and  question of experts – why had the artist of such  level remained unknown in the homeland for many years? \n\nGoldstein comes back to Russia in 1917. The ideas of vanguard dominating in native art are alien to him, all relations are lost. Goldstein works only for himself. During the 20-s and 30-s he paints penetrated with isolation and lyricism portraits of his family, sketches of northern nature. Grigoriy  Aleksandrovich died on May 5th, 1938 in Leningrad.\n\nThe name of Grigoriy Goldstein has been removed from history for long decades. Only in the late 90-s due to happy set of circumstances and mysterious events, the artist and his creativity come back thanks to the efforts of  St. Petersburg collector Dmitry Nefedov, the owner of the main heritage of the author. He managed not only to save the works of the artist from destruction and oblivion, but also to restore them, to organize a series of the most interesting exhibitions in St. Petersburg and Moscow which attracted attention of art lovers to Goldstein. It is enough to see his works just once and you immediately get under charm of the painting, penetrated by light of \"other worlds\", high culture and love to the world.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Григорий Гольдштейн","relatedArtists":["57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa47","57726d83edc2cb3880b48a13","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a21d","57726e06edc2cb3880b5638b","57726db9edc2cb3880b4eaa1","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e089","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ac6c","57726d89edc2cb3880b4965f","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a4fa","57726d7eedc2cb3880b47f72","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a5ee","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a3db","57726db1edc2cb3880b4dd28","5a9b426bedc2c968080a7c9e","57726e05edc2cb3880b561ee","57726d85edc2cb3880b48cef","57726e02edc2cb3880b55e4a","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4ee55","57726d85edc2cb3880b48d99","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e532"]},{"id":"57726da3edc2cb3880b4c71c","artistName":"Marjan Eggermont","url":"marjan-eggermont","lastNameFirst":"Eggermont Marjan","birthDay":"/Date(-126230400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1966","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/82ab39c6-6a09-4606-b0cc-e729020f7d3b.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad72c0","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7458","57726a68edc2ca38801d5001"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Marjan Eggermont is a contemporary artist.

The name Ştefănescu first belonged to artist’s great-grandfather, priest Stefan from Skopje.\r\n\r\nPainter’s destiny was forged during his school-years spent at Râmnicul Sărat; then, between 1933 and his mobilization on the front, the advice he received from masters Ion Theodorescu-Sion, Lucian Grigorescu and especially Nicolae Dărăscu mattered a lot. The latter, a palette virtuoso able to display a whole scale of hot-and-cold floral colours, made George Ştefănescu familiar with the secret of polychromy acquired patiently, by touch resuming, yet losing nothing of image luminosity.  \r\n\r\nThe seisms of the mid 20th-century history directed Ştefănescu towards plastic expressions with practical potentials: mural painting and decoration, advertising graphics, poster and especially scenography. His creation dedicated to theatre (1958–1974) re-adapted his sight to strong colours, as, for more than one decade, his perception had been harmed by the traumas endured in the Crimean campaign. Subsequently, the synthetic, ultra-suggestive manner of the graphic-pictorial sketches made for décors trained his interest for the poetic simili-figurative compositions whose folkloric approach used to conceal religious subjects – see the series of Minstrels or Flyers, which, resumed after 1990 in the free world, far from the local manoeuvres of the orthodox connivances, were turned into The Magi and Crucifixions after minimal interventions.\r\n\r\nIn Adriana Bobu’s monograph issued in 1987 at Meridiane Publ. House (Bucharest, Romania), the artist is approached in the key of a fauve, harmonically tamed expressionism. Without any ostentation, the painter captures from reality an extended cone of pretext stimuli, achieving a figuration stylized in arched-and-imbricated shapes resembling enamel compositions. An excellent example could be the canvas made in 1990: a whirl of tropical, strongly coloured birds developing an elaborate honest-figurative dynamics. More than any landscapist, Ştefănescu-Râmnic imagines parabolic-woven figures (meditative themes, harlequins, folk customs, dances), sublimated in graphemes mastered in the realm of lyrical abstraction. On the other hand, his still-lifes or toponymic landscapes are abundant of pretexts for different families of ripen nuances and contour arabesques. \r\n\r\nSecret of Blue is the title of the oil on canvas he achieved in 1983. But maybe even the red colour of old Balkan carpet stands for the sthenic leitmotif the painter had in mind. In the more recent series, showing a somehow thwarted abstract symbolism, the artist honours shape contours with a loosened-up warp background, while troubling sensually into the enamel depth of the painting.\r\nPainter’s figure, seems meditative and concentrated in the remarkable self-portraits of the man born during the Great War, seriously wounded in the Second World War, yet surviving United Europe enactment. The longeval artist is a wonderful example of seigniorial senescence nourished by a destiny able to defeat evil times, that Sadness of Young Women from the middle of the 20th century.

Miller was an English artist born in London who became famous for his idyllic representation of beach scenes in his home county of Cornwall. Most of his paintings were of the West Penwith peninsula and Tresco in the Isles of Scilly.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1970s John Miller emerged as a cultural figurehead within Cornwall. He became well known as a painter of popular, Monet-like Cornish scenes (many of which were cheaply reproduced as prints for the tourist trade), as an art teacher, a television personality, a patron of local charities and an active supporter of the Church of England. He was also responsible for some high profile architectural projects including a reordering of the interior of Newlyn Art Gallery.\r\n\r\nAt an advanced stage in his career John Miller’s artistic style underwent a radical change and by the mid-1990s his work (but not always his name) had become known worldwide as a result of the mass production and distribution of cheap posters, prints and cards with reproductions of his distinctive beach paintings: he produced the first of these in what was to become recognised as his trademark style in 1992. The beach scenes had enormous market appeal and have become firmly established as iconic images which - now much imitated - apparently spawned a genre. The paintings themselves, which Miller continued to produce in large numbers until his death in 2002, became highly sought after and were only available through selected London galleries at successive annual exhibitions which usually sold out well before their official opening dates.\r\n\r\nJohn Miller was elected to become a member of the Newlyn Society of Artists in 1961. John Miller, a household name in Cornwall since the mid-1970s, is an artist whose work continues to have an extremely high public profile, both in the UK and internationally. In a 2003 survey (for the periodical 'Art Business Today') of 200 United Kingdom high street gallery owners whose businesses specialised in posters and popular art reproductions, Miller was listed alongside Monet and L.S. Lowry among the ‘top-four’ best-selling landscape artists and fifth - above Van Gogh (7th), Picasso (8th), and Matisse (10th) - in a list of the current ‘top-ten’ best-selling deceased artists in all genres. John Miller’s work is currently (2004-5) the subject of academic investigation by a postgraduate student at the University of Kent, Canterbury, England.\r\n\r\nJohn Miller's works are currently (2009) viewable and sold at New Craftsman gallery in St.Ives.

landscapes, 1970"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Jeffrey Smart was an expatriate Australian painter acclaimed for his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/precisionism#!#resultType:masonry]precisionist[/url] urban and industrial landscapes. He applied a sharply defined style and hypergeometric compositional logics to the realist depiction of cityscapes. Smart spent most of his artistic life in Italy. There, he developed a peculiar aesthetic that combined a modernist visual vocabulary, originated in the context of 1940s Australian and American Modernism, with references to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance#!#resultType:masonry]High Renaissance[/url] art and deeply personal meanings. Road signs, oil drums and  blank façades of ordinary buildings are the most recurring elements in Smart's puzzling landscapes. With their absolute clarity, linearity and stillness, Smart's works are infused with mystery, mood, and ambiguity, inviting the viewer to contemplate on the symbolic meaning of everyday objects.\n \nSmart was born in Adelaide in 1921. His early fascination with drawing, architecture, and painting led him to enter the Adelaide Teachers College in 1939 and enroll part-time on the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/south-australian-school-of-design-adelaide#!#resultType:masonry]South Australian School of Arts and Crafts. [/url]In this period, Smart visited the studio of Adelaide-based artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dorrit-black]Dorrit Black[/url], who introduced him to the rules of dynamic symmetry, as seen in the work of the Old Masters and developed by avant-garde artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Cézanne[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque]Braque[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/fernand-leger]Léger[/url]. The 1940s were a period of artistic growth and raise to fame for Smart, who started to exhibit in group shows alongside other emergent Australian artists, including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacqueline-hick]Jacqueline Hick[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/horace-trenerry]Horace Trennery[/url], and was given in his first solo show at [i]Kosminsky Gallery[/i] in Melbourne in 1944. Smart described his works from this early period as \"snippets of nature\" that required no more than three or four hours to complete. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/water-towers-1944][i]Water towers[/i][/url] (1944) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/keswick-siding-1945][i]Keswick Siding[/i][/url] (1945) exemplify Smart's early sketchy style and use of earth tones. In 1945, Smart painted [i]The Waste Land I[/i] (1945) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/wastelands][i]The Waste Land II[/i][/url] (1945). These desolate rural views, inspired by T.S. Eliot's poem of the same name, point to the development of the artist’s distinctive hyper-clear and timeless version of landscape painting.\n \nBetween 1948 and 1950, Smart travelled to America and Europe, and then moved in Paris in 1949 to study at the Académie Montmartre under Fernand Léger. His several visits to European museum collections in this period will bring Smart to become particularly fascinated with the art of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini]Giovanni Bellini[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione]Giorgione[/url], and especially [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-della-francesca]Piero della Francesca[/url], whose clarity of forms and rigorous use of perspective will influence Smart's works indelibly. Upon his return to Australia in 1951, the artist settled in Sydney, where he will remain for the next twelve years. In the same year he won the Commonwealth Jubilee Prize for his painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/wallaroo-1951][i]Wallaroo[/i][/url] (1951). This scene of daily life from the copper-mining Australian town of Wallaroo was praised for its atmospheric effect and balanced composition. During his years in Sydney, Smart also worked as an art teacher and art critic at the [i]Daily Telegraph[/i] while continuing to paint landscapes. Works from this period, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/cooper-park-i-1962][i]Cooper Park I[/i][/url] (1962) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/cahil-expressway-1962][i]The Cahil Expressway[/i][/url] (1962) mark the beginning of Smart's mature style, characterized by an increased hyper-clarity and meticulously crafted compositions.\n \nThe 1963 was a crucial year in the artistic and personal life of the artist, who resumed his travels around Europe and permanently moved to Rome with Australian artist and partner [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ian-bent]Ian Bent[/url]. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Smart's artistic career gained momentum thanks to prominent solo shows and exhibitions in his homeland and around the world, such as the 1967 solo exhibition at the [i]Redfern Gallery[/i] in London and the inclusion in the American touring group show [i]The Australian painters 1964- 1966: Contemporary Australian Painting from the Mertz Collection[/i]. Between 1969 and 1970, Smart painted his largest work, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/all-works#!#filterName:Series_city-landscapes-1970,resultType:masonry][i]City landscapes[/i][/url] (1969-1970), a series of panels for the dining-room of the Sydney house of Tony and Sandra McGrath. The commission was designed and overseen by Smart, but Ian Bent executed much of the details. The mural depicts a tall hedge of yellow, withering spikes blocking the view into a bleak cityscape delimited by a leaden, threatening sky.  \n\nIn 1971, Smart purchased a farmhouse in Posticcia Nuova in the countryside of Arezzo, a small town in Tuscany, where he will remain for the rest of his life. The move to Tuscany marks the beginning of the most prolific period in the artist's career. Starting from the 1970s, Smart dedicated himself to interpreting the landscape of modern Italy, mixing his own personal and imaginary relationship with the land with a crystal-clear recording of precise details of climate, life, and landscape. Paintings from the 1970s and 1980s, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/the-arezzo-turn-off-ii][i]The Arezzo turn-off II[/i][/url] (1973) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/the-dome][i]The Dome[/i][/url] (1977), show repeating architectural motifs, geometric shapes, and highly-controlled patterns of light and shadow as guiding principles in the creation of rigidly structured compositions. While most of Smart's artistic production includes landscapes, in the 1980s and early 1990s the artist also worked on a small number of portraits and self-portraits, in which he staged a stark contrast between accurate likenesses and visionary urban contexts, as seen in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/portrait-of-germaine-greer-1984][i]Portrait of Germaine Greer[/i][/url] (1984), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/self-portrait-at-papinis-1985][i]Self-portrait at Papini’s[/i][/url] (1984-1985), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/portrait-of-clive-james-1992][i]Portrait of Clive James[/i][/url] (1991-92).\n \nA sketch the artist took during a train journey of the platform at the English station of Ashford transformed into [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeffrey-smart/matisse-at-ashford-2004][i]Matisse at Ashford[/i][/url] (2004), one of his most relevant works from his later years. Struck by the motif of a series of posters advertising an exhibition of Matisse’s cut-outs, Smart later reworked this fleeting recollection into a rigid grid of horizontal and vertical lines dominated by the rhythmic arrangement of the billboards and a cool palette.

In 1928 there were reported cases of vandalism towards two sculpture-paintings by Kochar in the exhibition at the Salon des Indépendants.

Among the participants of the exhibition were Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Robert Delaunay, Henri Matisse, Picabia, Pablo Picasso, Liursa, Joan Miró and others.

Naumovski was born in 1924 in the Macedonian city of Ohrid (then part of Yugoslavia). He was interested in art at a young age, but this led nowhere as he left school after third grade and worked a series of odd jobs -- gardener, farmer, butcher. After a stint in the army, he enrolled in art school in Skopje in 1946, lasting a year. He then worked in a woodcarving shop in Ohrid for thirteen years. During this time he was painting, initially in a folk myth style which led to him being considered a Naive artist.\r\n\r\nIn the early 60s his painting morphed into a gooey sort of surrealism. He first exhibited in Yugoslavia in the 50s, and later had one-man shows in Rome, London, Paris, and Toronto. At some point he started a gallery in his home in Ohrid (it is unknown whether it is still open). He died in 2006.

redefined sculpture by introducing into it the element of movement. He created sculptures and design objects that participated in the larger tendencies of European and American avant-garde, uniquely combining [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-art#!#resultType:masonry]abstract art[/url], modernist principles, machine and cosmic imagery in his works. His major contribution to the modernist redefinition of artistic media is the invention of two new categories of sculpture, called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_mobile,resultType:masonry][i]mobiles[/i][/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_stabile,resultType:masonry][i]stabiles[/i][/url]. \n \nThe [i]mobiles[/i] are constructions made of suspended objects that hang down from the ceiling and continuously move with the flow of air. These evolving sculptures served to Calder’s exploration of sculpture and its site of display, which led him to introduce space and movement as fundamental elements in the encounter of the audience with the work of art. In their movable nature, Calder's mobiles can be seen as an example of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/kinetic-art#!#resultType:masonry]Kinetic art[/url]. The [i]stabiles[/i] are large-scale fixed versions of the [i]mobiles[/i], which the artist created in his late years. These monumental abstract sculptures were installed in urban spaces around the world and contributed to revamping the conversation around public sculpture in the last decades of the 20th century. \n \nCalder was born in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia in 1898 to artistic parents. His father was a successful sculptor, and his mother worked as a portrait painter all her life. Calder's early fascination with sculpture began at the age of nine in his father's studio, where he started experimenting with mechanical devices and materials such as wire, sheet metal and wood. He created there his first constructions based on animal-designs. The fascination with construction and industrial materials would later bring Calder to graduate in mechanical engineering. The studies in physics and applied kinetics will crucially effect the artist’s early experiments with mechanized constructions. After trying many disparate jobs, Calder decided to follow his artistic leanings, and in 1923 enrolled at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/art-students-league#!#resultType:masonry]Art Students League[/url] to study drawing and painting. \n \nAt that time, the Art Students League's faculty was composed by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/eight#!#resultType:masonry]The Eight[/url] - a group of realist artists whose determination to bring art into closer touch with everyday life greatly influenced the course of American art. Calder's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/all-works#!#filterName:Style_american-realism,resultType:masonry]first large canvases[/url] and drawings of that period were directly inspired by his instructors' broad realist style and their ideas of freedom of artistic expression.\n\nIn 1926, Calder made the first of many trips to Paris with the desire to gain first-hand exposure of European Modernism. He became fascinated with the European incorporation of non-academic artistic media in sculptural practices as well as with the new stylistic directions in American art, which were building on the influence of European [url href=Cubism]Cubism[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/futurism#!#resultType:masonry]Futurism[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/constructivism#!#resultType:masonry]Constructivism[/url]. Elements of Constructivism and its notion of achieving painterly effects through sculptural materials are particularly evident in Calder's works from 1926 to 1930. These include sculptures made of a single metal wire, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/josephine-baker-iii-1927][i]Josephine Baker[/i][/url] (1927), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/rearing-stallion-1928][i]Rearing Stallion[/i][/url] (1928), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/portrait-of-a-man-1929][i]Portrait of a Man[/i][/url] (1929). These experiments with wire culminated in the creation of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/calder-s-circus-1931][i]Calder's Circus[/i][/url] (1926-1931), a miniaturized rendering of a circus featuring a complex arrangement of figurines of performers, animals and props. Made of wire, wood, metal, cloth, leather, these sculptures were specifically designed to be manipulated by Calder.  The artist gave performances of his kinetic circus in New York and Paris throughout the 1930s, receiving critical acclaim for his elaborate creation of a moving sculptural ensemble.\n \nBy 1928, Calder had started to gain popularity and was given his first solo show in New York at [i]Weyhe Gallery[/i]. Throughout the 1930s, he continued to exhibit in New York, Paris and Berlin, and developed friendships with European and American avant-garde artists, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro]Joan Mirò[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/marcel-duchamp]Marcel Duchamp[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/fernand-leger]Fernand Lèger[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian]Piet Mondrian[/url]; as Calder recalls in his autobiography, a visit to Mondrian's studio was a \"shock\" that led him to embrace complete abstraction. The move towards abstraction translated into the creation of a series of kinetic sculptures, dubbed [i]mobiles[/i] by Duchamp, including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/crank-driven-mobile-1932][i]Crank-driven Mobile[/i][/url] (1931-32), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/dancing-torpedo-shape-1932][i]Dancing Torpedo Shape[/i][/url] (1932), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/a-universe-1934][i]A Universe[/i][/url] (1934). Calder incorporated mechanisms and motors in these abstract constructions to make the separate elements move at different speeds, using the materials' density and weight as guiding principles in planning the sculpture's movement in space. He later gave up motorized constructions and dedicated himself to designing self-moving sculptures hanging down from a ceiling which could be activated by air currents. He also created stationary abstract works that [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-arp]Jean Arp[/url] dubbed [i]stabiles[/i]. The first of Calder’s outdoor works were made during this era as well. \n\nThe 1930s see Calder moving back to the United States and working on the construction of sets for ballets by Martha Graham and Erik Satie. In 1931, he was also invited to join the group [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/abstraction-cr-ation#!#resultType:masonry]Abstraction-Création[/url], which included artists Jean Arp, Piet Mondrian, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-helion]Jean Hélion[/url]. Disks, spheres, wedges, and triangles in a rigorous palette of primary colors, black, and white, became the fundamental elements of Calder's mobiles from 1935 and 1936. Starting from 1936, the artist started to work on larger scale sculptures with the desire to generate even more dramatic casual spatial relationships. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/lobster-trap-and-fish-tail-1939][i]Lobster Trap and Fish Tail[/i][/url] (1937), a mobile commissioned by the [i]Museum of Modern Art[/i] in New York for the museum's stairwell, points towards this new monumental direction, as well as to Calder's interest in organic forms.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Calder became internationally known - a unique position for an American sculptor at the time, - and was honoured with many prizes, commissions, and exhibitions. In 1945, Marcel Duchamp arranged a crucial exhibition of small-scale works made by Calder with scrap metal pieces at [i]Galerie Louis Carré[/i] in Paris; Jean Paul Sartre wrote a seminal essay on the artist’s mobiles for the accompanying catalogue. \n\nIn his late years, Calder dedicated himself to large-scale projects, stabiles, and various public commissions, including the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/125-1975][i].125[/i][/url] mobile (1957) for the John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/teodelapio-1962][i]Teodelapio[/i][/url] (1962) for the city of Spoleto, Italy, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexander-calder/flamingo-1973][i]Flamingo[/i][/url] (1973), a monumental red-painted steel stabile for the Federal Center Plaza in Chicago. In 1966, Calder published [i]An Autobiography with Pictures[/i], a witty illustrated account of the artist’s personal life and prolific artistic career. Calder died in 1976 at the age of seventy-eight, a few weeks after visiting a major retrospective of his work at the [i]Whitney Museum of American Art[/i] in New York.\n\n\n[i]by Caterina Franciosi[/i]","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Alexander 'Sandy' Calder","relatedArtists":["57726da6edc2cb3880b4cc95","57726de8edc2cb3880b5365a","57726dd5edc2cb3880b517f4","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cd51","57726dc5edc2cb3880b4fe18","57726da5edc2cb3880b4cacc","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bf03","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4beb9","57726df8edc2cb3880b54ddc","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e81d","57726ddbedc2cb3880b520bb","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dc48","57726dcdedc2cb3880b50a15","57726da5edc2cb3880b4c9dc","57726db9edc2cb3880b4ea11","57726dc7edc2cb3880b50144","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bd2a","57726dd6edc2cb3880b5183a","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f87c","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c53c"]},{"id":"57726dd2edc2cb3880b512a8","artistName":"Odd Nerdrum","url":"odd-nerdrum","lastNameFirst":"Nerdrum Odd","birthDay":"/Date(-812073600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 8, 1944","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/odd-nerdrum.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Nerdrum","dictionaries":["57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e48","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f91","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7258"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Odd Nerdrum, Norwegian figurative painter and founder of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/kitsch#!#resultType:masonry]Kitsch[/url] movement, has been a controversial figure in the world of contemporary art. Since the early phases of his career Nerdrum has positioned himself as an outsider. His interest in the tradition and craftsmanship of Old European Masters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url] countered the dominant trends of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/conceptual-art#!#resultType:masonry]Conceptual[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-painterly-abstraction#!#resultType:masonry]Abstract[/url] art of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOdd Nerdrum was born in Sweden in 1944 to Norwegian parents, who returned to Norway after the end of World War II. Nerdrum began his artistic education at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/oslo-national-academy-of-the-arts-oslo-norway#!#resultType:masonry]Art Academy in Oslo[/url], but quickly became discontent with the academy because of the emphasis on modern art. Instead he focused his energy on teaching himself to paint in a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neo-baroque#!#resultType:masonry]Neo-Baroque[/url] style and learning the traditions of European painting. This put Nerdrum at odds with many of his instructors and pupils, causing him to feel isolated among his peers. Later, he studied at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/kunstakademie-dusseldorf-dusseldorf-germany#!#resultType:masonry]Arts Academy of Düsseldorf[/url] under leading German conceptual and performance artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joseph-beuys]Joseph Beuys[/url]. At the beginning of his career, Nerdrum dealt with contemporary social issues, like the sexual revolution in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/liberation-1974][i]Liberation[/i][/url] (1974) and poverty in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/morning][i]Morning[/i][/url] (1972). His most famous painting from the period is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/the-murder-of-andreas-baader-1978][i]The Murder of Andreas Baader[/i][/url] (1977-1978), which dealt with the death of Andreas Baader, one of the founders of the Baader-Meinhof group, a far left militant organization.\n\nDuring the early the 1980s, Nerdrum changed direction artistically, especially in terms of subject matter. According to scholars, the first sign of this change is the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/twilight][i]Twilight[/i][/url] (1981), which portrays a young woman defecating in a forest clearing. The painting signified the change of subject matter: Nerdrum started to turn away from issues of modern society and concentrated instead on portraying the primal human experience. In subsequent paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/iron-law-1984][i]Iron Law[/i][/url] (1983-1984) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/the-ultimate-sight-1985][i]The Ultimate Sight[/i][/url] (1985), Nerdrum developed a new world that described an archetypal existence. His figures are most often situated in apocalyptic environments – mainly severe landscapes that were influenced by his studies of the Icelandic landscapes.\n\nNerdrum’s artistic sensibility is closest to the painting of Baroque painters, Old Masters like Rembrandt and Caravaggio. In his art, Nerdrum calls for a return to the tradition and craftsmanship of European painting. At the opening of his 1998 retrospective at the Astrup Fearnley Museum in Oslo, Nerdrum declared he was not an artist, but a kitsch painter. He later presented his manifesto [i]On Kitsch[/i], which outlined his aesthetics principles. For Nerdrum, kitsch is an artistic device that through narrative and sentiment portrays the human experience, and in the postmodern context it can be a form of avant-garde expression. In a way, Nerdrum’s embrace of kitsch affirms his critique of contemporary art. \n\nNerdrum also acts as a teacher and mentor in a project named [i]The Nerdrum School[/i]. There, he works to advance the teaching of traditional painting methods, like mixing and grinding pigments, stretching out canvases and using life models.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Odd

Mehring was a twentieth century painter born in Washington, D.C. He is associated with Color Field painting and the Washington Color School and the artists at Jefferson Place Gallery. Mehring and Robert Gates both received grants from The Woodward Foundation to travel in Europe during 1971 to broaden their art backgrounds. His connection with Vincent Melzac was instrumental in developing his work. Early in his career (1956–1958) he shared studio space with Thomas \"Tom\" Downing, with whom he had been a student of Kenneth Noland at Catholic University. Some of their paintings from that period are difficult to tell apart.\r\n\r\nMehring's early work is a \"Washington version\" of abstract expressionism, with the loose handling of paint on a surface but a much more transparent use of magna paint, an acrylic paint developed by Leonard Bocour. The stylistic resemblance to Mountains and Sea by Helen Frankenthaler is obvious.\r\n\r\nAs Mehring developed as an artist his work became much more structured. He went from a painted surface with an all-over pattern to cutting up canvas with the all-over pattern and gluing it back together.

de László was a major Hungarian painter known particularly for his portraits of royal and aristocratic personages.\r\n\r\nLászló was born in Budapest as Laub Fülöp Elek (Hungarian style with the surname first), the eldest son of a Jewish tailor. The family changed its name to László in 1891. He apprenticed at an early age to a photographer while studying art, eventually earning a place at the National Academy of Art, where he studied under Bertalan Székely and Károly Lotz. He followed this with studies in Munich and Paris. László's portrait of Pope Leo XIII earned him a Grand Gold Medal at the Paris International Exhibition in 1900. In 1903 László moved from Budapest to Vienna. In 1907 he moved to England and remained based in London for the remainder of his life, although traveling the world to fulfill commissions.\r\n\r\nLászló's patrons awarded him numerous honors and medals. In 1909 he was named an honorary Member of the Royal Victorian Order by King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. In 1912 he was ennobled by King Franz Joseph of Hungary; his surname became \"László de Lombos\". The family later shortened the name to \"de László\".\r\n\r\nLászló became a British citizen in 1914 but was interned for over twelve months in 1917 and 1918 during the First World War.\r\n\r\nLászló suffered a heart attack in 1936. The following year he had another heart attack and died at his home in Hampstead, near London. In 1939, the book Portrait of a Painter. The Authorized Life of Philip de László by Owen Rutter, written in conjunction with de László, was published.

Modernist set and costume designer Petre Otskheli was undoubtedly an outstanding professional of his time. A great deal of his drawings were created for stage productions but the sophisticated nature of his sketches effortlessly turns them into autonomous masterpieces of graphic arts, imbued with independent aesthetic value. Critics speculate about why he decided to remain in theatre instead of becoming an independent artist. The answer is that theatre meant so much to him precisely because it allowed him to capture the figures of some of Georgia’s greatest artists and use them as models for his art. \n\nOtskheli’s formative years coincided with the tremendous cultural movement flourishing at the beginning of the 20th century in Europe. A vital new culture known as ‘modernist’ art was being born. It gained force as it moved along opening up artists around the world to new artistic possibilities, leaving a profound mark also on leading artists in Georgia. These creative impulses were so powerful that it took years for the totalitarian Soviet ideology to suffocate them and they thrived until the late 1930s. For some reasons, film and theatre retained this drive longer than the other arts. The same is true in case of stage and costume design for theatre.

Here she followed lessons in painting and drawing, later in graphic print art. \nFine print art became her specialization during her last years 1990-1992.\nHilly van Eerten moved to Amsterdam in 1993 where she lives and works till now. Without any delay she started here to print on the Amsterdams Grafisch Atelier (AGA).\n\nAs starting independent graphic artist Hilly van Eerten made lithography prints on paper till circa 2000. She preferred this print-technique because printing lithography gave her many possibilities to put her colors painterly on the stone.\nIt was at this Amsterdam Print Studio that she discovered the possibilities of mono-type / mono-print, one of her colleagues there practiced. This print-technique enabled Hilly van Eerten to start with her own photos as visual basic material and to print them as a way of collage art.  \n\nHer style of mono-print was and still is rather unusual because the final result gives only one unique art-print: a mono-print. This is the consequence of starting the creative process with a pile of black-white copies of selected images from photos she made earlier. After selecting these visual elements in copy she arranges and combines them in the print process itself. It is really ‘collaging’ how she combines these visual elements by printing them in successive print runs, next to & over each other. By this way of creating each used copy got destroyed after one print-run - unique, unrepeatable art-prints.  \n\nThis way of printing Hilly van Eerten started circa 2000, using a series of photos she took of the German border crossing Check Point Charley. These photos showed a mixture of buildings, texts, signs and construction activities. \nBy copying these images in black-white and cutting and pasting them, some photo-collages emerged gradually.\nThese photo-collages inspired Hilly van Eerten to transfer the images in print art. At first she mixed them in lithography prints but soon the monotype-technique suited her the best. She wanted to finish with a series of unique prints.  \nAlso her photos of New York City Manhattan got transformed in prints in the same way. These unique prints of New York Gates became circa 2001 here first series of mono-types which pleased her.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2006 other subjects appeared in her mono-types like paving stones, roof tiles and fishing nets – all with its characteristic structures. \nIn 2006 The Urban Dutch City got a leading role in the mono-type art of Hilly van Eerten. Especially the construction sites and building pits in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague she found very attractive subjects for her collage print art, because of its dynamic transformation and the important role of the material aspect of buildings, streets and constructions.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Hilly van

was a prominent Russian art theorist, painter, and poet. He began art lessons in St. Petersburg at around fourteen years of age, and in 1908, at around age 25, entered the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts. After his expulsion from the Academy in 1910, he joined the Russian art group Soyuz Molodyozhi, and was a contributor to the group’s magazine. In 1912, he published an essay The Canon and the Law in which he expounded his ideas on analytical realism, also known as “Universal Flowering,” which refuted the surface geometry of cubism. Filonov’s artistic philosophy revolved around the desire to reveal the inner soul of the objects in the painting, a belief system he remained devoted to his entire life. Later in his artistic career he was also close to Russian futurist painters Vladimir Mayakovsky and Velimir Khlebnikov.  \r\n\r\nUpon the beginning of World War I, Filonov enlisted and served on the Romanian front. Perhaps his experiences in the war led him to also be an active member in the Russian Revolution of 1917, serving as Chairman of the Revolutionary War Committee of Dunay Region. His first exhibition was in 1919, after the tumult of the war and revolution, and beginning in 1923 served as a professor at the St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts, the same academy from which he had been expelled thirteen years earlier. \r\n\r\nDuring his career he organized the large art school of Master of Analytical Realism, which eventually had up to seventy members. Staying true to his artistic theory, Filonov rarely made money from his paintings, as he refused to sell them to individual patrons. His desire was to give them all to the Russian Museum as a gift, so they could start a Museum of Analytical Realism. His economic hardships worsened, however, due to the strict Soviet restrictions on artists and their exhibitions, and he starved to death in 1941, during the Nazi Siege of Leningrad. \r\n\r\nFor a time after his death, it was forbidden to exhibit any of Filonov’s works, which would have made them easy to steal. There was a legend, however, that his paintings were protected by the ghost of Filonov, and anyone trying to steal them would die, become paralyzed, or suffer a terrible misfortune. Filonov’s desire to gift his works to the Russian Museum was finally realized after his death, when many of his works, which had been saved by his sister, were given to the museum.

He studied at the Fine Arts Institute, Bucharest (1950-56). Although his artistic education in Romania neglected the work of modern European artists, he acquired a sound knowledge of classical art and managed to discover the expressive values of modern art. His first figurative works reveal a sensitive use of colour and a taste for chromatic nuances in the contours. From 1963 to 1968 he worked and exhibited in Rome. Here he turned towards an allusive abstract art with a tendency to lyricism. After 1965 Nicodim moved towards a lyrical abstraction of reality (that shares with the color field and monochrome paintings of international art certain features) in his paintings, as he depicted in symbolic form such natural phenomena as fields, birds and lakes. He also made a series of colour engravings entitled The Rainbow in the Grass. In the mid-1970s he produced some compositions with figurative-human themes containing a profoundly tragic message, such as Requiem for the Unknown Soldier which attracted the hostility of official ideological circles. In the 1970s he also concentrated on large-scale tapestries with allusive symbolic subjects, one of which is displayed at the United Nations headquarters in New York. Two further tapestries, one on the theme of the four elements, and the other incorporating the Renaissance theme of Man as symbol of the cosmos, are displayed in the National Theatre in Bucharest. In 1975 he received from ONU the Planetary Citizen award, with the occasion of the Conference about Human Survival. From 1976, in response to the hostility aroused by Requiem for the Unknown Soldier, he established a studio in Paris (where he remained until his death), where he again worked on large canvases, including The Yellow Field and The Earth, as well as a cycle entitled The Hearts, which included a series of earth and straw sculptures in the form of tall poles supporting hearts, sometimes crudely coloured, and intended to invoke the ancestral archaism of the Romanian rural environment.\r\n\r\nIlinca Nicodim-Gèze and Patrick Gèze have published in 2012 the album Ion Nicodim at the Humanitas Publishing House (edition in Romanian and French).

With Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian he founded the De Stijl art movement.\r\n\r\nSon of a house painter, he started his career learning how to make stained glass in a shop in Utrecht. An example of his later stained glass work is in the Kröller-Müller Museum in Hoge Veluwe, Netherlands.\r\n\r\nAfter having met Mondrian and van Doesburg and having founded the Stijl movement with them, his style became completely abstract, as did Mondrian's. But after disagreements with Mondrian his abstract style became based on representational images. His painting Tryptich is an example, in which he transformed sketches of a mine in Spain into seemingly abstract shapes.\r\n\r\nIn 1919-1920 he created the interior design for St Hubertus Hunting Lodge, in the Hoge Veluwe estate. The hunting lodge was designed by Hendrik Petrus Berlage. In 1930, he was commissioned by Jo de Leeuw, owner of the prestigious Dutch department store Metz & Co. to design interiors, window packaging, branding and advertising. For these print materials van der Leck developed a rectilinear, geometrically constructed alphabet. In 1941, he designed a typeface based on this alphabet for the avant garde magazine Flax. Architype van der Leck, a digital revival of that face by David Quary and Freda Sack of The Foundry, was released in 1994.\r\n\r\nBart van der Leck claimed to be the father of the avant-garde movement. In his own words he said: \"Mondrian came to my place one day with Doesburg, whom I had never seen before. When Doesburg noticed an abstract painting right on the easel, he exclaimed: 'If that is to be the painting of the future, may I be hanged right now!' Well, a few months later, he was painting in precisely that manner. That's the sort of person Doesburg was. No ideas of his own.

Hofmann was a German-born American abstract expressionist painter.\r\n\r\nHofmann was born in Weißenburg, Bavaria on March 21, 1880, the son of Theodor and Franziska Hofmann. When he was six he moved with his family to Munich. Here his father took a job with the government.\r\n\r\nStarting at a young age, Hofmann gravitated towards science and mathematics. At age sixteen, he started work with the Bavarian government as assistant to the director of Public Works where he was able to increase his knowledge of mathematics. He went on to develop and patent such devices as the electromagnetic comptometer, a radar device for ships at sea, a sensitized light bulb, and a portable freezer unit for military use. Even with such great abilities in science and mathematics, Hofmann became interested in creative studies, beginning educational art training after the death of his father.\r\n\r\nIn 1932 he immigrated to the United States, where he resided until the end of his life.\r\n\r\nHofmann's art work is distinguished by a rigorous concern with pictorial structure, spatial illusion, and color relationships.\r\n\r\nHis completely abstract works date from the 1940s. Hofmann believed that abstract art was a way to get at the important reality. He famously stated that \"the ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak\".

Her interest in art started at early age. In her early twenties she moved to New York City to study at the Art Students League with Kimon Nicolades. In the late 1930s she began to study with Hans Hofmann in New York City as well as in Provincetown, MA. In 1950 she was nominated by Willem de Kooning and then admitted to the 8th Street “Artists’ Club”, located at 39 East 8th Street.\n\nPerle Fine was chosen by her fellow artists to show in the Ninth Street Show held on May 21 – June 10, 1951.[5] The show was located at 60 East 9th Street on the first floor and the basement of a building which was about to be demolished. According to Bruce Altshuler: \"The artists celebrated not only the appearance of the dealers, collectors and museum people on the 9th Street, and the consequent exposure of their work but they celebrated the creation and the strength of a living community of significant dimensions.\"\n\nPerle Fine participated from 1951 to 1957 in the invitational New York Painting and Sculpture Annuals, including the Ninth Street Show., She was among the 24 out of a total 256 New York School artists who was included in all the Annuals. These Annuals were important because the participants were chosen by the artists themselves.\n\nIn the 1950s Fine moved to the Springs, section of East Hampton on the eastern end of Long Island where Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner. Willem de Kooning, Conrad Marca-Relli and other members of the New York School found permanent residence.\n\nPerle Fine stated the following: \" I never thought of myself as a student or teacher, but as a painter. When I paint something I am very much aware of the future. If I feel something will not stand up 40 years from now, I am not interested in doing that kind of thing.\"\n\nPerle Fine died of pneumonia on May 31, 1988, at the age of 83 in East Hampton, New York.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Perle

Dzubas was a German-born American abstract painter.\r\n\r\nFriedel Dzubas studied art in his native land before fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939 and settling in New York City. In Manhattan during the early 1950s, he shared a studio with fellow abstract painter Helen Frankenthaler. He began exhibiting his Abstract expressionist paintings at this time. His work was included in the Ninth Street Show in New York City in 1951, and in group exhibitions at the Leo Castelli gallery, the Stable Gallery, and the Tibor de Nagy Gallery among others. After the Ninth Street Show annual invitational exhibitions were held at the Stable Gallery throughout the 1950s. The poster of the second New York Painting and Sculpture Annual at The Stable Gallery in 1953, included an introduction by Clement Greenberg.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s he became associated with Color field painting and Lyrical Abstraction. He was included in Post-painterly abstraction, a 1964 exhibition curated by Clement Greenberg. Dzubas was a friend of Clement Greenberg, who in turn introduced him to Jackson Pollock and other artists.\r\n\r\nHis large work (up to 24 feet (7.3 m) wide) became more fluid. During the last three decades of his career, Dzubas had more than sixty solo exhibitions around the world. He was represented by the André Emmerich gallery and Knoedler Contemporary Arts in New York for more than thirty years. In 1976 he settled in Massachusetts, but also painted and lived in New York City, where his paintings were regularly exhibited.\r\n\r\nHe used Magna paint an oil based acrylic paint. Magna was originally developed by the paintmakers Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden for and also used by Morris Louis. Dzubas would apply thick layers of color over washes, scrubbing the paint into the unprimed canvas. Dzubas used staining, brushing and other ways of applying color. His paintings were generally large in size and scale, but he made many very small paintings as well.

Riopelle was a painter and sculptor from Quebec, Canada.\r\n\r\nBorn in Montreal, he studied under Paul-Émile Borduas in the 1940s and was a member of Les Automatistes movement. He was one of the signers of the Refus global manifesto. In 1949 he moved to Paris and continued his career as an artist, where he commercialized on his image as a \"wild Canadian\". In 1959 he began a relationship with the American painter Joan Mitchell. Living together throughout the 1960s, they kept separate homes and studios near Giverny, where Monet had lived. They influenced one another greatly, as much intellectually as artistically, but their relationship was a stormy one, fueled by alcohol. The relationship ended in 1979. His 1992 painting Hommage à Rosa Luxemburg is Riopelle's tribute to Mitchell, who died that year, and is regarded as a high point of his later work.\r\n\r\nRiopelle's style changed gradually from Surrealism to abstract expressionism/tachisme, in which he used myriad soft cubes of colour, applied as flat planes with a palette knife, on large canvases to create powerful atmospheres.\r\n\r\nIn 1969 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, and began to spend more time in Canada. He was specially recognized by UNESCO for his work. One of his largest compositions was originally intended for the Toronto airport, but is now in the Opéra Bastille in Paris. In 1988 he was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec and was promoted to Grand Officer in 1994. In 2000 Riopelle was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.\r\n\r\nIn June, 2006 the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts organized a retrospective exhibition which was presented at the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia and the Musee Cantini in Marseilles, France. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts has a number of his works, spanning his entire career, in their permanent collection.

She was an essential member of the American Abstract expressionist movement, even though much of her career took place in France. Along with Lee Krasner, Grace Hartigan, and Helen Frankenthaler, she was one of her era's few female painters to gain critical and public acclaim. Her paintings and editioned prints can be seen in major museums and collections across America and Europe.\r\n\r\nMitchell was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of James Herbert and Marion Strobel Mitchell. She studied at Smith College in Massachusetts and The Art Institute of Chicago. After moving to Manhattan in 1947, she wanted to study at Hans Hofmann's school in New York but, according to Jane Livingston in her 2002 essay (\"The Paintings of Joan Mitchell\"), Mitchell attended only one class and declared, \"I couldn't understand a word he said so I left, terrified.\" She traveled in 1948 in France, Spain, and Italy. In 1951, her work was exhibited in the landmark \"Ninth Street Show\" alongside that of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Hans Hofmann. By the early 1950s, Mitchell was regarded as a leading artist in the New York School. In her early years as a painter, she was influenced by Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Wassily Kandinsky, and later by the work of Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning, among others.\r\n\r\nMitchell married American publisher Barney Rosset in 1949 in Paris. Rosset is a Chicago-born American entrepreneur and former owner of the publishing house Grove Press, who is perhaps best known as the American publisher of the controversial and sexually charged novel Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. They divorced in 1952. In 1955, Mitchell moved to France to join Canadian painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, with whom she had a long, rich, and tumultuous relationship. They maintained separate homes and studios, but had dinner and drank together daily. They first lived in Paris, and then moved west to the town of Vétheuil, near Giverny, Claude Monet's home.\r\n\r\nHer paintings are expansive, often covering two separate panels. Landscape was the primary influence on her subject matter. She painted on unprimed canvas or white ground with gestural, sometimes violent brushwork. Her paintings are highly expressive and emotional.\r\n\r\nDuring the period between 1960 and 1964, Mitchell moved away from the all-over style and bright colors of her earlier compositions, instead using sombre hues and dense central masses of color to express something inchoate and primordial. The marks on these works were said to be extraordinary: \"the paint flung and squeezed on to the canvases, spilling and spluttering across their surfaces and smeared on with the artist's fingers.\" She said that she wanted her paintings \"to convey the feeling of the dying sunflower\" and \"some of them come out like young girls, very coy ... they’re very human.\" \r\n\r\nMitchell died in 1992 in Vétheuil, near Giverny France. The Joan Mitchell Foundation awards grants and stipends to painters, sculptors, and artist collectives. It is located in Manhattan at 545 West 25th Street.

\"Larry\" Zox (May 31, 1937 – December 16, 2006) was an American painter and printmaker who is classified as a Color Field painter and a Lyrical Abstractionist, although he did not readily use those categories for his work.\r\n\r\nZox was born in Des Moines, Iowa to Oscar and Mildred (née Friedman) Zox, but moved to New York City at an early age. He lived an artist's life, running in the circles of many prominent names in the art world. In recent years he had relocated to his second home in Colchester, Connecticut. Zox was considered an abstract artist; often he described himself as a colorist.\r\n\r\nZox received his education at Oklahoma University and Drake University. He studied with George Grosz at the Des Moines Art Center. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation. He was Artist-in Residence at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Dartmouth College, and Yale University.\r\n\r\nHis work has been exhibited in many one-person and group shows including the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York); the Museum of Modern Art (NY); Albright-Knox Art Gallery (Buffalo, New York); Art Institute of Chicago; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (NY). In recent years his work has been exhibited at the Stephen Haller Gallery in New York City and Rocket Gallery, London.\r\n\r\nHe died, aged 69, from cancer and was survived by his second wife, the former Virginia King, his two children from his first marriage Alexander and Melinda, a brother Alan Zox, a sister Susan Zox-Smith, and his brother-in law, the painter David R.

He lives in New York and Eagles Mere. Marden is represented by the Matthew Marks Gallery.\r\n\r\nHe studied at Boston University School of Fine and Applied Arts, receiving his BFA in 1961, and to 1963 at Yale University School of Art and Architecture. In the following year he produced his first single-panel monochromatic paintings, through which he contributed to the emerging aesthetic of Minimalism. Bringing together the painterly quality of Abstract Expressionism with the intellectual rigours of Minimalism, Marden achieved a balance between emotional intensity and formal simplicity.\r\n\r\nIn his early paintings Marden left a bare narrow margin at the bottom edge of the thickly worked surface of oil mixed with wax to allow the observer to be witness to the process. In later works he developed subtle colour combinations by joining together panels of a single colour in either vertical or horizontal formats. From 1975, when he began making annual visits to Greece, he took inspiration from the light and colour of its landscape and also made reference to mythology in his choice of titles. After preparing designs for stained-glass windows for Basle Cathedral in 1977, he became interested in expressing in his paintings the conditions of colour and light in architecture.\r\n\r\nAfter producing a series of 25 etchings in which he made reference to Chinese ideograms, he introduced a network of meandering lines into his paintings. These works for which monochrome panels now acted as background colour fields, provided a dramatic departure from his previous style, but they continued to stress the importance of touch, surface, colour and tone.

He was given his outlandish name in 1964, during his studies with Bruno Goller and Joseph Beuys at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf between 1962 and 1967. The name refers to Frank \"Blinky\" Palermo, an American Mafioso and boxing promoter who was famous at the time for \"owning\" Sonny Liston. According to legend, it was given to Schwarze at the suggestion of Beuys when the teacher noticed the physical resemblance between Schwarze and the gangster.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, Palermo moved to Mönchengladbach and set up a studio he would share with Imi Knoebel and Ulrich Rückriem. After a stay in New York in the early 1970s, he moved into Gerhard Richter's former Düsseldorf studio.\r\n\r\nBlinky Palermo died in Malé, aged 33, while on vacation on Kurumba island, Maldives in 1977 (of causes that often are referred to as \"mysterious\" but widely acknowledged as related to Palermo's drug use). His brother Michael Heisterkamp is the sole heir and owner of the copyright of Palermo.\r\n\r\nPalermo was best known for his spare monochromatic canvases and \"fabric paintings\" made from simple lengths of colored material cut, stitched and stretched over a frame. He painted on aluminum, steel, wood, paper and Formica, often making lines out of tape instead of paint. Later in his career, Palermo would develop his work in situ for large-scale architectural installations. From 1968 he realized more than twenty murals and wall drawings at various sites in Europe, including Edinburgh and Brussels, and recorded them in preparatory sketches and photographic documentation. Palermo's first solo show was held in 1966 at Galerie Friedrich+Dahlem in Munich. Before his death, he further participated in more than seventy exhibitions, most notably at documenta in 1972 and 1977. Along with Georg Baselitz and Sigmar Polke, he represented Germany at the 13th Bienal de São Paulo in 1975. In 1976, his work Himmelsrichtungen was shown at the Venice Biennale.\r\n\r\nPublic collections holding major works by Palermo include the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Tate Gallery, London, and Dia Art Foundation, New York. Most of the artist's work, however, remains in the possession of private collectors and museums in Europe.\r\n\r\nPalermo's auction record is held by Untitled (Stoffbild) (1967-69), a large square panel of cotton fabric on burlap, painted with two bands of solid color of uneven height, respectively dark blue and turquoise. Auctioned from the collection of Gerhard and Anna Lenz at Sotheby's London in 2010, it fetched £1.11 million.

Poliakoff was a Russian-born French modernist painter belonging to the 'New' Ecole de Paris (Tachisme).\r\n\r\nSerge Poliakoff was born in Moscow in 1906, the thirteenth of fourteen children. His father, a Kyrgyz, supplied the army with horses that he bred himself and also owned a racing stable. His mother was heavily involved with the church, and its religious icons fascinated him. He enrolled at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, but fled Russia and the Russian Revolution in 1917. He arrived in Constantinople in 1920, living off the profits from his talent as a guitarist.\r\n\r\nHe went on to pass through Sofia, Belgrade, Vienna, and Berlin before settling in Paris in 1923, all the while continuing to play in Russian cabarets. In 1929 he enrolled at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. His paintings remained purely academic until he discovered, during his stay in London from 1935 to 1937, the abstract art and luminous colours of the Egyptian sarcophagi. It was a little afterwards that he met Wassily Kandinsky, Sonia and Robert Delaunay, and Otto Freundlich.\r\n\r\nWith these influences, Poliakoff quickly came to be considered as one of the most powerful painters of his generation. In 1947, he was trained by Jean Deyrolle in Gordes in the Vaucluse region of France amongst peers such as Gérard Schneider, Giloli, Victor Vasarely, and Jean Dewasne. By the beginning of the 1950s, he was still staying at the Old Dovecote hotel near Saint-Germain-des-Prés, which was also home to Louis Nallard and Maria Manton, and continuing to earn a reliable income by playing the balalaika. A contract enabled him to quickly gain better financial stability.\r\n\r\nIn 1962 a room was given over to his paintings by the Venice Biennial, and Poliakoff became a French citizen in the same year. His works are now displayed in a large number of museums in Europe and New York. Poliakoff also worked with ceramics at the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres. He influenced the paintings of Arman.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, works by Poliakoff were chosen by the Musée du Luxembourg for their exhibition entitled 'L'Envolée lyrique (lit:'Lyric Flight').

He is known as \"the master of black\" because of his interest in the colour, \"...both a colour and a non-colour. When light is reflected on black, it transforms and transmutes it. It opens up a mental field all of its own\". He sees light as a matter to work with; striations of the black surface of his paintings enable him to make the light reflect, allowing the black to come out from darkness and into brightness, thereby becoming a luminous colour.\r\n\r\nBefore World War II, Soulages already had toured museums in Paris seeking his vocation and after wartime military service, he opened a studio in Paris, holding his first exhibition at the Salon des Indépendants in 1947. He also worked as a designer of stage sets.\r\n\r\nIn 1979, Pierre Soulages was made a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\r\n\r\nFrom 1987 to 1994, he produced 104 stained glass windows for the Romanesque Abbey church Sainte-Foy in Conques (Aveyron, France).\r\n\r\nSoulages is the first living artist invited to exhibit at the state Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg and later with the Tretyakov Gallery of Moscow (2001).\r\n\r\nA composition he created in 1959 sold for 1.200.000 euros at Sotheby's in 2006.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the Musée Fabre of Montpellier devoted an entire room to Soulages, presenting his donation to the city. This donation includes twenty paintings dating from 1951 to 2006, among which are major works from the 1960s, two large plus-black works from the 1970s, and several large polyptychs.\r\n\r\nA retrospective of his art was held at the Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou from October 2009 to March 2010. In 2010, the Museo de la Ciudad de Mexico presented a retrospective of Soulages' paintings that also included an interview-video with the painter (Spanish subtitles).

Mathieu was born in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, and gained an international reputation in the 1950s as a leading Abstract Expressionist. His large paintings are created very rapidly and impulsively. Despite his unconventional technique, he considers himself an historical painter working with abstract subject matter. His paintings are related to American Lyrical Abstraction and to Art informel as well.\r\n\r\nMathieu lacked a formal art education. In 1947 he was working for American Express in Paris, France and rented a chambre de bonne near the Palais Luxembourg. There he executed a number of large canvases with a black background on which he painted colored scrolls, whorls and other shapes. He subsequently refined his technique, using a white background on which he painted simple geometrical forms, most often a single line in color. In the 1950s he exhibited fifty of these canvases at the Leicester Galeries in London.

He began to paint in his childhood. In his adolescence the wish of being painter became much stronger. That is why in 1991 Soltan came to Baku to enter the former Azerbaijan State School of Arts named after Azim Azimzade, but he failed. Returning to the village and continuing his education there Soltan got attached to the painting very much, he increased his contacts with the nature and tried to feel the nature profoundly. \nSoltan's father was against to his son's wish. That is why Soltan painted his paintings secretly. He understood that not leaving the village he wouldn't reach his wishes. He had only a way to come to Baku in order get high education. He had also a great interest to the literature. So in 1993 Soltan entered the philology faculty of Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University and graduated it in 1997. During 1997-2000 years he got the magister degree according to the linguistics of that university. \nComing to Baku Soltan got interested in painting very much, he went to the exhibitions and visited the famous painters' and sculptors' studios, wrote articles about them and always wanted to learn. His intention was decisive: to enter the School of Arts! \nSoltan had enough information about the art. He carried out the generalizations about the painters' activity and tried to explain works to himself. According to Soltan's thought the activity of all painters he had seen looked like to one another. But it gave anxiety to him: why were all painters' activities alike? In that case was it necessary to get the education of art?! \nIn 1995 in order to get the painting education Soltan went to the lectures at the former Azerbaijan State Art School named after Azim Azimzade and saw the deficiency of the traditional education for the activity in his dreams, then he decided not to get the painting education decisively. His goal was to become a different painter. Who and where would teach him that difference? That is why he preferred to study himself. \nSo Soltan wanted to create his style. He wished to become a sensible and amazing painter sourcing from the deep layers of the human intellect, surrounding the philosophical, thinking and the eternal ideas. \nThe question “How to become difference?” interested him very much. In order to get the answer of this question he began to read very much, studied Azerbaijan painting art and found the main point: in existing period Azerbaijan painting was deprived from the thinking, philosophy, the thought had no clear, correct, philosophical expression. Azerbaijan literature and mugham having the great tradition is more philosophical than the Azerbaijan painting. It means one can create such philosophical thinking in painting.\nAfter all these Soltan came to the conclusion that painting was not only the description art, mainly, it was the art of thinking. The painter understood that when the art expressed the reality it was superficial and transitory. That is why the art must learn the eternal themes and create its everlasting maintenance. And this activity had to be far from the misunderstanding now addressed by many people. \nThe paintings by Soltan are the mature examples of the modern art and painting. In these works one can see the deep theme layers. He tries to reveal the theme to the audience completely and considers it his duty. According to his thought if the work is not clear to the painter-creator then it is also not clear to the audience. In short, the painter not having the clear thought can't create the unquestionable work! The painter must paint the most philosophical work so easily that the audiences can understand it without difficulty. \nThe intellect and philosophy are the main peculiarities for Soltan's activity. The painter not accepting any misunderstanding as “deep”, “philosophical” doesn't want to deceive the audience, he tries to enlarge the dream world of the humanity with his works and to show the essence of the real world. According to the painter’s thought each work is the explanation of something. That is why it is not necessary to explain the work, on condition that, the work to be painted clearly.\nSoltan believes his fantasy and in his paintings creates the faith in the audience. These descriptions are unreal. That is why he names his works “irreal”. “Irreal” is unreal thing. But the unreal thing presented by the art is the real! But where can one see it? Only in the thought, thinking, dream, essence! It means the world doesn't consist of only reality; it also consists of the deep, philosophical unreality. So the main aim of the unrealism belonging to Soltan is the deep intellectual, philosophical, logical approach. According to Soltan’s thought the main demand of irrealism is to paint the unreality convincingly, logically, philosophically, clearly and simply. The art of painting should persuade people to the life, the future, not to create the terrible pessimism, the horrifying thoughts in them, and not to deprive the audience to the impatience, misunderstanding and depression. It is the main difference of the irrealism from the surrealism. Surrealism tells that the themes sourced from the sub-consciousness create the upper level of realism, but in order to simplify the difficulty, it makes much more difficult and puts the audience to the deepest impression. But irrealism does it on the contrary. It is sourced not from the subconscious, but from the high consciousness. Thus, it brings the human to the truth in a convincing way. According to Soltan’s thought, when the audience can’t understand the work they should not blame themselves and must not tell “May be I do not understand”. Because everything in the world is understandable. There is no inconceivable work for the audience in the painting, there is a work created by the intellectual incompetence of the author. From this point of view, irrealism imposes the serious demands in front of the author firstly, the artist brings the truth together with the audience, conveys it to the essence of the reality and opens the new opportunities for the thinking. \nSoltan is also a graphic and a caricaturist. Soltan has won prizes in many exhibitions and expositions, his works have taken part in many international catalogues. His works are kept in museums and private collections in different countries.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Soltan Soltanlı","relatedArtists":["594b4586edc2c912247f5a91","5a85023bedc2c9584c46dc78","57726daaedc2cb3880b4d280","58a4d687edc2c9a52099af32","5bb292e5edc2c9101c47e986","58af20c6edc2c9b5f07b3148","57726dd2edc2cb3880b51205","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cd75","599f130dedc2c963a4196945","5c054c5fedc2c92768d98fbd","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a2a7","57726d7bedc2cb3880b479f1","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e4ad","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f7c5","59bf10c3edc2c9bb64e743b1","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b650","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4eed7","57726dcbedc2cb3880b50717","57726de5edc2cb3880b53166","57726ddbedc2cb3880b520d3"]},{"id":"5c18a4a4edc2c914801ed695","artistName":"Yuri Zlotnikov","url":"yuriy-zlotnikov","lastNameFirst":"Zlotnikov Yuri","birthDay":"/Date(-1252627200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1477353600000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 23, 1930","deathDayAsString":"October 25, 2016","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00215/images//5c18a464edc2c914801daf07.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2,_%D0%AE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87","dictionaries":["5804eadaedc2ce45b4e01a76","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d81","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e69","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71f8","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71f0"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"5c3ee724edc2c927cc100000","title":"Rythm.

Carlos Castagnino (November 18, 1908 – April 21, 1972) was an Argentine painter, architect, muralist and sketch artist.\r\nBorn in the rural village of Camet, near the city of Mar del Plata, he studied in the Escuela de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires, and became a disciple of Lino Enea Spilimbergo and Ramón Gómez Cornet.\r\nBy the end of the 1920s, he became a member of the Communist Party of Argentina. In 1933 he joined the first Argentine artists' guild, and later that year he exhibited at the National Fine Arts Hall in Buenos Aires. His work, predominantly realist in his earlier years, became more figurative, later on, and though his Communist affiliation was reflected in numerous works with social undertones, he painted a wide variety of subject matter.\r\nAlong with Antonio Berni, Spilimbergo and Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, he created a series of murals for a villa belonging to local businessman Natalio Botana, in Don Torcuato. Castagnino traveled to Paris in 1939, where he attended the atelier of cubist painter André Lhote, later traveling across Europe perfecting his art and in the company of Georges Braque, Fernand Léger and Pablo Picasso, among others. Castagnino returned to Argentina in 1941, where he enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires and obtained a degree in architecture.\r\n\r\nHe received numerous awards in subsequent years, including the Grand Prize of Honor of the Argentine National Hall (1961), the Medal of Honor at Expo '58 (Brussels, 1958), and a special mention for his drawings at the II Mexico City Biennale of 1962. His illustrations for a EUDEBA (University of Buenos Aires Press) edition of José Hernández's Martín Fierro (the national poem of Argentina), gained wide recognition.\r\nCastagnino died in Buenos Aires in 1972. Following its relocation to the landmark Villa Ortiz Basualdo, the Municipal Museum of Art in his native Mar del Plata, to which the artist had contributed over 130 works, was renamed in his honor in 1982.

„quite possibly the greatest colorist since Matisse”. He was one of the best-known American Color field painters, although in the 1950s he was thought of as an abstract expressionist and in the early 1960s he was thought of as a minimalist painter. Noland helped establish the Washington Color School movement. In 1964 Noland occupied half the American pavilion at the Venice Biennale. In 1965 his work was exhibited at the Washington Gallery of Modern Art and the Jewish Museum (New York). In 1977 he was honored by a major retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York that then traveled to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC. and the Toledo Museum of Art, in Ohio in 1978. In 2006 Noland's Stripe Paintings were exhibited at the Tate in London.\r\n\r\nInstead of painting the canvas with a brush, Noland’s style was to stain the canvas with color. This idea sought to remove the artist through brushstrokes. This made the piece about the art, not the artist. He emphasized spatial relationships in his work by leaving unstained, bare canvas as a contrast against the colors used throughout his paintings. Noland used simplified abstraction so the design would not detract from the use of color.

Each composition is the result of a deliberative process guided by careful attention to spatial relationships. Working slowly, he accumulate paint gradually, allowing the process of arriving at a given formation to take precedence.\n\nGibbons is a non-representational abstract painter born in Montreal, now living in Toronto. He generally works with acrylic paints, but does a great deal of combining materials and mediums. Schooled in the visual arts and in architecture (ultimately receiving a license to practice), his works have been exhibited in arts fairs & galleries across the USA, Canada & internationally.\n\nIn 2014, Gibbons was featured by Acrylic Artist Magazine as one of the 29 Top Painters. His 3 gallery tour of China in 2007-2008 landed him a feature on Arts & Culture in 2008 with Dr. Yawei Ciu on OMNI-TV. Over the last 8 years, his works have been exhibited in 7 solo shows, 8 group shows, plus 2 TV features & several magazines. The works of Charles Gibbons have found their way into art collections in Nashville, New York, Naples, Toronto, Montreal, and internationally in Singapore, Beijing & Tokyo.\n\nAll of his works endeavour's to transcend time. He does not want to create art that addresses current fads, or requires dialogue to be understood and appreciated. His works reaches into the cultural soul, now and for the future. After over 30 years in the art world,  over 50 exhibitions, a couple of books, several magazine articles, Gibbons works are still evolving.\n\nThe Contemporary Art Review said after my last New York show that “One of the most impressive qualities that emerges out of each work of Charles Gibbons is its lyrical drive which forms a visual choreography of parts related to wholes as well as voids and subtle coloristic tonalities connected to compositional shapes. The compelling drama of energized suspension pervades all of Gibbons’ artistic work.”\nGibbons strongest artistic influences are a combination of architects, artists, and mathematicians. For mathematics is the study of abstraction + logic, shapes + motion which are all present in art. All his works explores the structure of energy and space.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["57726d7aedc2cb3880b478b9","57726d89edc2cb3880b4967b","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a6d5","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4baf1","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bca9","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bf13","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4c064","58f4ee7cedc2c90ffc3690a3","57726dc5edc2cb3880b4fd6f","595d4aa6edc2c9514c09dec3","5a357ef6edc2c90f18dbfb0c","592ba050edc2c922acf77c2b","57726dc0edc2cb3880b4f5fb","57726df2edc2cb3880b54492","57726decedc2cb3880b53b1d","58d92d6eedc2cf82e062f427","5ac8f4baedc2c9d01803d212","57726df1edc2cb3880b54350","580bbc4aedc2c9a2b4e0b981","57726de4edc2cb3880b52fa8"]},{"id":"5c316220edc2c90f08e9d394","artistName":"Carlos Quizpez Asín","url":"carlos-quizpez-asin","lastNameFirst":"Asín Carlos Quizpez","birthDay":"/Date(-2200003200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(410227200000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 15, 1900","deathDayAsString":"1983","image":"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/00218/images//carlos-quizpez-as-n-in-madrid-1926.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Quizpez_As%C3%ADn","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d71","57726a67edc2ca38801d4dd1","57726a67edc2ca38801d4dd9","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7340"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Carlos Quizpez Asín","relatedArtists":["57726d7eedc2cb3880b47e74","57726d80edc2cb3880b48351","57726d84edc2cb3880b48b8d","592e4177edc2c97bc8fa78c8","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e6de","57726d87edc2cb3880b49407","5a35ca02edc2c90f18f65a76","57726dc4edc2cb3880b4fd3f","57726ddbedc2cb3880b520bb","57726dd6edc2cb3880b518bb","57726da6edc2cb3880b4ccf3","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4bfba","57726db2edc2cb3880b4df81","57726dbcedc2cb3880b4f02e","57726df3edc2cb3880b546da","57726dfcedc2cb3880b55425","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ec43","582a8625edc2c9a69c2994e2","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ac84","57726d9aedc2cb3880b4b78c"]},{"id":"57726da6edc2cb3880b4cb61","artistName":"Anita Malfatti","url":"anita-malfatti","lastNameFirst":"Malfatti Anita","birthDay":"/Date(-2527113600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-162604800000)/","birthDayAsString":"December 2, 1889","deathDayAsString":"November 6, 1964","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/0d18307f-97de-48e1-b8a1-ef6001430f93.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Malfatti","dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad72c8","57726b4bedc2cb3880ad6910","57726a67edc2ca38801d4dd9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Anita Catarina Malfatti is heralded as the first Brazilian artist to introduce European and American forms of Modernism to Brazil.

His artistic development is almost always expressed in thematic cycles, resembling cinematographic sequences. Firstly, the so-called green paintings, dedicated to the relationship between man and nature (1971-1973). Then [i]La cena[/i] (1975-1976) and, at the beginning of the 1980s, the twenty paintings and fifteen studies of the [i]Immaginazione e memoria della famiglia[/i]. From 1985 he produced the series [i]La sera o della riflessione[/i]. From the year 2000 he created the [i]Notturno[/i] cycle. \nAfter classical studies, and artistically self-taught, he learnt the rudiments of his art from his uncle. Sughi first exhibited in a collective exhibition in Cesena in 1946 and, in the same year, he spent a period of time in Turin, where he worked as an illustrator for the newspaper Gazzetta del Popolo.  Between 1948 and 1951 he worked in Rome, where he met various artists, among whom Marcello Muccini and Renzo Vespignani from the [i]Gruppo di Portonaccio[/i], a fundamental meeting for Sughi, both from the personal and the artistic point of view.\nHe returned to Cesena in 1951. These were the years when the “existential realism” movement was formed. Renato Guttuso supported it and Antonello Trombadori compared it to the style of Edward Hopper. At the beginning of the ‘70s Sughi moved from the city of Cesena to the nearby hills of Carpineta and started work on the cycle La cena , a clear metaphor for middle class society, containing a certain Germanic realism, resembling the works of George Grosz and Otto Dix, enveloped in almost metaphysical atmospheres, isolating every character and freezing them within the scene. \nEttore Scola chose one of the paintings from the Cena cycle as a poster for his film [i]La Terrazza[/i], and Mario Monicelli was inspired by Sughi’s atmospheres and colours in his [i]Un borghese piccolo piccolo[/i]. In 1978, La cena was exhibited in Moscow at the Manezh Gallery. In 1980 Sughi started work on a new narrative cycle entitled[i] Immaginazione e memoria della famiglia[/i]. Together with his large triptych, [i]Teatro d’Italia[/i], painted between 1983 and 1984, it showed that the artist had returned to the theme of modern society. [i]Teatro d’Italia[/i] is, in fact, a great social allegory. \nSughi has taken part in all the most important contemporary art events, from the Biennale Internazionale d’Arte in Venice to the Quadriennale in Rome – of which he has also been Director – and to numerous exhibitions. Both Italian and foreign museums have shown many retrospective exhibitions of his work. \nOn 28 November 2005, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi presented him with the prestigious Vittorio De Sica Prize, as homage to an artist who, ever since his early works, has shown a particular feeling for the cinema, even going as far as to state that “the cinema taught me how to paint”. \n\nAmong others, the following critics have written about the work of Alberto Sughi: G. Amendola, G. Bassani, F. Bellonzi, R. Bossaglia, F. Caroli, E. Cavalli, L. Cavallo, G. Cavazzini, R. Civello, E. Crispolti, M. De Micheli, A. Del Guercio, F. Ferrarotti, D. Guzzi, P. Levi, R.

In 1937, Nikolaou follows Yiannis Moralis to Italy and in 1939 he receives a scholarship to study in Paris. \r\n\r\nIn 1949 he formed, with other artists including Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas, Yannis Tsarouchis, Yiannis Moralis, Nikos Engonopoulos and Panayiotis Tetsis, the \"Armos\" art group. This group had its first exhibition in 1950 in Athens' Zappeion.

Francis was an American painter and printmaker. He was born in San Mateo, California, and studied botany, medicine and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. He served in the United States Air Force during World War II before being injured during test flight maneuvers. He was in the hospital for several years, and it was while there, after being visited by artist David Park in 1945, that he began to paint. Once out of the hospital he returned to Berkeley, this time to study art.\r\n\r\nFrancis was initially influenced by the work of abstract expressionists such as Mark Rothko, Arshile Gorky and Clyfford Still. He spent the 1950s in Paris, having his first exhibition there in 1952. While there he became associated with Tachisme. He later spent time in Japan, and some have seen an influence from Zen Buddhism in his work.\r\n\r\nFrancis spent some time in Paris executing entirely monochromatic works, but his mature pieces are generally large oil paintings with splashed or splattered areas of bright contrasting color, with areas of white canvas left to show through. Francis painted large murals for the Kunsthalle, Basel in 1956-8 and for the Chase Manhattan Bank, New York in 1959. In the early 1960s, Francis began his \"Edge\" series in which paint is sometimes confined to the margins of the canvas.\r\n\r\nFrancis returned to California during the 1960s and continued painting, mainly in Los Angeles, but also in Tokyo where he lived primarily in 1973-4. During the final three decades of his career his style of large scale bright Abstract Expressionism, which featured spontaneous and gestural applications of acrylic paint and washes, was also closely associated with Color Field painting.\r\n\r\nIn 1984 Francis founded The Lapis Press with the goal of producing unusual and timely texts in visually compelling formats.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year of his life, suffering from prostate cancer and unable to paint with his right hand after a fall, in a final burst of energy he used his left hand to complete a dazzling series of about 150 small paintings before he died. He was buried in Olema, in Marin County, California.\r\n\r\nOn May 11, 2010, a Francis 1957 painting titled \"Middle Blue\" was sold at auction for $6,354,500, a record for the artist.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the artist's death, the Sam Francis Foundation was founded. Its stated mission is to \"research, document, protect and perpetuate the creative legacy of the artist\" and \"promote awareness of and knowledge about the art of Sam Francis to the public through education and information.\" The U.S. copyright representative for the Francis Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation recently published, in collaboration with the University of California Press, a Catalogue Raisonné of Francis' Canvas and Panel Paintings, 1946 - 1994. The catalogue consists of both a printed book and 2 DVDs which document 1,855 Francis paintings. There are also photos, writings by and about Francis, and films of Francis at work. Foundation Director Debra Burchett-Lere is currently working on a second volume which will feature all of the artist's known unique works on paper. The Foundation has a page dedicated to locating any \"missing works\" and is requesting information from any parties who can assist in their location.

Together with German-American painter Lyonel Feininger and German sculptor Gerhard Marcks, under the direction of German architect Walter Gropius, Itten was part of the core of the Weimar Bauhaus.\r\n\r\nHe was heavily influenced by Adolf Hölzel and Franz Cižek, in Vienna using the work and textbook of Eugène Gilliard, an abstract painter, as a base. From Hölzel, Itten adopted a series of basic shapes (the line, the plane, the circle, the spiral) as a means from which to begin creation, and the use of gymnastic exercises to relax his students and prepare them for the experiences that were to occur in the class.\r\n\r\nFrom 1919 to 1922, Itten taught at the Bauhaus, developing the innovative \"preliminary course\" which was to teach students the basics of material characteristics, composition, and color. In 1920 Itten invited Paul Klee and Georg Muche to join him at the Bauhaus. He also published a book, The Art of Color, which describes these ideas as a furthering of Adolf Hölzel's color wheel. Itten's so called \"color sphere\" went on to include 12 colors. In 1924, Itten established the “Ontos Weaving Workshops” near Zurich, with the help of Bauhaus weaver Gunta Stölzl.\r\n\r\nItten was a follower of Mazdaznan, a fire cult originating in the United States that was largely derived from Zoroastrianism. Itten's mysticism and the reverence in which he was held by a group of the students some of who converted to Mazdaznan (e.g. Georg Muche) created conflict with Walter Gropius who wanted to move the school in a direction that embraced mass production rather than solely individual artistic expression. The rift led to Itten's resignation from the Bauhaus and his prompt replacement by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy in 1923. From 1926 to 1934 he had a small art and architecture school in Berlin, in which Ernst Neufert, the former chief-architect of Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus, taught as well from 1932 to 1934.\r\n\r\nItten's works exploring the use and composition of color resemble the square op art canvases of artists such as Josef Albers, Max Bill and Bridget Riley, and the expressionist works of Wassily Kandinsky.\r\n\r\nItten's work on color is also said to be an inspiration for seasonal color analysis. Itten had been the first to associate color palettes with four types of people, and had designated those types with the names of seasons. Shortly after his death, his designations gained popularity in the cosmetics industry with the publication of Color Me A Season. Cosmetologists today continue to use seasonal color analysis, a tribute to the early work by Itten.

He met Syrian artist Wahbi Al-Hariri there and the two would share a friendship for the rest of Kayyali's life. Al-Hariri would become his mentor as he was for artist Fateh Moudarres that Hariri introduced to Kayyali in 1955. Moudarress and Kayyali would together represent Syrian modern art at the Venice Biennial Fair. He suffered from depression and died in 1978 from burns incurred from his bed catching fire, reportedly from a cigarette.\r\n\r\nHe graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome in 1961 and returned to Syria where he started his career as a fine arts professor at Damascus University where Fateh Moudarres also taught. That same year, the International Modern Art Hall of Damascus hosted his exhibit of 28 oil paintings on canvas and 30 sketches.

was born and raised in Mesa, Arizona.

He graduated with a BFA in Design with an emphasis on Illustration. He has enhanced his skills by studying the masters and engaging in pure practice out in nature. He paints using a method called French Barbizon Impressionism, a school of style popular from about 1830 to 1875, which influenced many of the most famous impressionists. It is named after a town south of Paris. The technique employs subtle tones and colors, with softness in the landscapes portrayed. Few people today are painting using this technique, and McNaughton is considered by some to be the premiere French Barbizon Impressionist.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Jon Mcnaughton","relatedArtists":["5a8d2a32edc2c9fc9ccfcf54","5a55f1fdedc2c98a7c83af22","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d7d3","59bb84b7edc2c98e14a35ec1","57726de7edc2cb3880b5341c","59bb9a31edc2c98e1401fdde","57726d9bedc2cb3880b4b8e4","59ee5b25edc2c918f45d4c4f","57726dd2edc2cb3880b512a8","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d782","57726de6edc2cb3880b53298","57726da0edc2cb3880b4c2ef","57726dd9edc2cb3880b51dfa","57cd0c87edc2c99704d99df1","57726dd6edc2cb3880b51867","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e175","598d4248edc2c955f8d5bae0","57726dcfedc2cb3880b50ea2","5915fb55edc2c9372019d1b8","57726df5edc2cb3880b548cf"]},{"id":"5c51ca73edc2c92af8f2dcb3","artistName":"Fabrizio Birimbelli (Pupazarro)","url":"pupazarro","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(-108086400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"c.July 30, 1966","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00224/images/pupazarro/1.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":[],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"5c51c893edc2c92af8100000","title":"The Art of Football"},{"id":"5c55ba9aedc2c917b0100000","title":"Sporting Greats"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726d9cedc2cb3880b4bada","artistName":"Alfred Stevens","url":"alfred-stevens","lastNameFirst":"Stevens Alfred","birthDay":"/Date(-4627670400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-1999382400000)/","birthDayAsString":"May 11, 1823","deathDayAsString":"August 24, 1906","image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/alfred-stevens.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Stevens_(painter)","dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad7278","57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Alfred Émile Léopold Stevens","relatedArtists":["582e2f0fedc2c9cf9cc22c39","57726e00edc2cb3880b55a73","57726e04edc2cb3880b5612f","5a306197edc2c9cbe86e68f1","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a453","579712bcedc2c989d0dba87b","57726d9aedc2cb3880b4b738","57726d91edc2cb3880b4a7c7","57726dfcedc2cb3880b553f9","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f28c","5a2458a4edc2c93d34ae32fa","5bc5d6b3edc2c912148824db","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a59c","57726dbcedc2cb3880b4ef83","57726dceedc2cb3880b50cbb","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e794","57726d98edc2cb3880b4b333","57726daaedc2cb3880b4d23a","57726d96edc2cb3880b4b0cc","57726dfdedc2cb3880b554e7"]},{"id":"5c48bb32edc2c923d0aaa394","artistName":"Don Kenn","url":"don-kenn","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(252460800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1978","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00220/images//opq-johnkenn-20140110-0014.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57ad71dbedc2c946ec3c7461"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"John Kenn Mortensen","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"5c51d776edc2c92af8739a2e","artistName":"Alan Lee","url":"alan-lee","lastNameFirst":"Lee Alan","birthDay":"/Date(-705888000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"August 20, 1947","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/00225/images/alan-lee/alan-lee.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lee_(illustrator)","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e8","59ca0cc7edc2c92484f3fede","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e70"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Alan Lee was born and raised in London, where he studied graphic art and design. Enchanted by myth and folklore from an early age, he gravitated toward the field of book illustration — following in the footsteps of Arthur Rackham and Edmund Dulac, master illustrators of the nineteenth century. Alan worked as an illustrator in London until the mid-1970s, when he moved to Dartmoor with fellow-artists Marja Lee Kruyt (to whom he was married for many years) and Brian Froud. At the urging of Ian Ballantine (the legendary American publisher), Alan and Brian created the book Faeries, inspired by the Dartmoor countryside. It went on to become a bestseller, published to acclaim all around the world.   \nSince that time, Alan has established himself as one of England's preeminent book artists, creating exquisite watercolor paintings for, among other works, The Mabinogion, Castles, Merlin Dreams, and Black Ships Before Troy: The Story of the Illiad (winner of the pretigious Kate Greenaway Award), and for the lavish anniversary edition of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.  \n \nFor the last few years, however, book projects have been set aside while he labors on the New Zealand set of Peter Jackson's film trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. As conceptual designer for the films, it is Alan's job to create the distinctive \"look\" of Middle Earth. A comparison of the films to Alan's prior illustrations for The Lord of the Rings gives a clear idea just how influential Alan's vision has been to the project. He has also designed for other films, including Legend, Erik the Viking, and Merlin.  \n \nWhen not working on film locations, Alan still makes his home on Dartmoor in southwest England, where his studio takes up two floors of an ancient, rose-covered stone barn. In the same small village as mythic artists Brian & Wendy Froud, William Todd-Jones, Terri Windling, and others. He was one of the founders of the annual Mythic Garden exhibition of outdoor sculpture at the Stone Lane Gardens arboretum; and is involved in the creation of a woodland non denominational spiritual retreat building along with Diana Marriott and the internationally known local sculptor Peter Randall Page. His interests include myth and folklore, literature, poetry, music (particularly jazz, blues, and the singing of June Tabor), archaeology, history, international travel, and long walks through Devon woodland. He has two children, Virginia (also a sculptor) and Owen. Their mother, Marja, from the Netherlands, is a talented painter herself, as well as a Celtic harpist.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["59a20219edc2c99d709d5a63","5ac90a8dedc2c9d018749aed","5c054c5fedc2c92768d98fbd"]},{"id":"5c54c494edc2c905bcb22b66","artistName":"Stickman","url":"stickman","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(151718400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"October 23, 1974","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00221/images//slash-on-the-nightrain.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f91","57726a67edc2ca38801d4f31","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"5c54bb0dedc2c905bc100001","title":"Rock Stars"},{"id":"5c59568eedc2c9296c100002","title":"Rebels"},{"id":"5c59568eedc2c9296c100003","title":"Rogues"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Trevor \"Stickman\" Stickel","relatedArtists":["5a34fdb2edc2c9cae090015a","5b35e592edc2c92434f9d709","57726e01edc2cb3880b55c56","581132e6edc2c93778e8d77d","5a5f2081edc2c90b688ba8fa","59fa3025edc2c976586d4413","57726da7edc2cb3880b4ce86","5ac90a8dedc2c9d018749aed","57726de8edc2cb3880b53612","59f37886edc2c9ac907e3b7c","57726de5edc2cb3880b53135","57726defedc2cb3880b54106","57726d95edc2cb3880b4ae1b","580f217dedc2c9826864b08d","57726de1edc2cb3880b52a90","5b745aebedc2c91e28dcf5a7","57726db4edc2cb3880b4e252","58389066edc2c9762c999127","57726dcaedc2cb3880b505d3","57726db8edc2cb3880b4e912"]},{"id":"57726d95edc2cb3880b4ad44","artistName":"Alekos Kontopoulos","url":"alekos-kontopoulos","lastNameFirst":"Kontopoulos Alekos","birthDay":"/Date(-2082844800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(157766400000)/","birthDayAsString":"1904","deathDayAsString":"1975","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/5f4bdb29-9b30-42f6-a335-0aa21ca2bc6a.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d81","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7210","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e09"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Κοντόπουλος Αλέκος","relatedArtists":["57726deaedc2cb3880b5371e","57726df6edc2cb3880b54b93","57726db9edc2cb3880b4ea11","59f24419edc2c98860993b48","57726de4edc2cb3880b52fe2","57726dc7edc2cb3880b50144","5a3e8676edc2c9cfcc596ae9","57726de5edc2cb3880b53166","5a15cc0bedc2c9efd0dd2c91","57726db9edc2cb3880b4eb8b","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e5a0","57726dc8edc2cb3880b50343","57726dfbedc2cb3880b55251","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4c0b1","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e4d9","57726da0edc2cb3880b4c1a5","57726da7edc2cb3880b4ce30","58403d67edc2c946646e1e22","57726d97edc2cb3880b4b190","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b5d2"]},{"id":"5c58265dedc2c92f84e82d2d","artistName":"Christian Attersee","url":"christian-ludwig-attersee","lastNameFirst":"Attersee Christian","birthDay":"/Date(-926035200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"August 28, 1940","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00225/images/christian-ludwig-attersee/scaled-200x250-ischinn-attersee-christian-1.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Attersee","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7218","57726a67edc2ca38801d4ee9","57726b4dedc2cb3880ad6c58","57726a67edc2ca38801d4f31"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"5c752f16edc2cd0978100000","title":"A GUIDE TO AUSTRIA FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS (1964-1965)"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Christian Ludwig Attersee","relatedArtists":["57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f400","57726db8edc2cb3880b4e9a8","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ecdb","57726db2edc2cb3880b4df6d","57726ddeedc2cb3880b5272b","57726dc8edc2cb3880b50201","57726dd2edc2cb3880b51178","57726de1edc2cb3880b52b3e","57726db9edc2cb3880b4ea75","57726db2edc2cb3880b4deb5","57726daeedc2cb3880b4d8c9","57726dededc2cb3880b53c7f","57726db1edc2cb3880b4de75","57726dd3edc2cb3880b513b8","57726d87edc2cb3880b49315","57726dc5edc2cb3880b4fe30","57726dd8edc2cb3880b51c90","57726db2edc2cb3880b4dea1","57726dcdedc2cb3880b50a29","57726de5edc2cb3880b53121"]},{"id":"57726d7aedc2cb3880b47901","artistName":"Joseph Beuys","url":"joseph-beuys","lastNameFirst":"Beuys Joseph ","birthDay":"/Date(-1546300800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(504921600000)/","birthDayAsString":"1921","deathDayAsString":"1986","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00142/images/joseph-beuys/beuys-feldman-gallery.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Beuys","dictionaries":["57726a68edc2ca38801d4f61","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad6678","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7248","57726a67edc2ca38801d4ef1","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ed0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Joseph Beuys was a German sculptor, painter, installation artist, art theorist and art pedagogue, and is considered one of the most influential European performance artists. In his early school years, he was considered to have a natural talent for drawing, and he visited the sculpting studio of Achilles Moortgat many times. His later childhood was spent in the era of the Nazi Third Reich. When he was 15 years old, he was a member of the Hitler Youth, and participated in the Nuremburg rally. In 1941, he volunteered for the German Luftwaffe, first acting as an aircraft radio operator, and later part of various bombing missions in the Crimea. In 1944, Beuy’s plane was shot down on the Crimean Front. Beuys was the only person to survive the crash, and later claimed to have been rescued by Tartar tribesmen, who covered him with animal fat and felt to keep him warm and nursed him back to health. Eyewitness accounts, however, claim that although Beuys was the only one to survive the crash, there were no Tartar tribesmen. He was instead rescued by a German search commando, and taken to a military hospital where he stayed for three weeks. He was redeployed later the same year, and held as a prisoner of war after the German surrender in 1945.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to civilian life, Beuys became an active member in the art community, and an outspoken proponent of anthroposophy, which posited that one could experience the spiritual world through inner development. He graduated from art school in 1953, to a dire financial situation, which was compounded by the traumas he experienced in war. By 1956, he was facing a serious depression, due to his materially and psychologically impoverished situation, from which he recovered and married his wife Eva Wurmbach in 1959. \r\n\r\nBeuy’s financial situation improved in 1961 when he was appointed professor of sculpture at the Dusseldorf Academy. It was during his tenure at the academy that he released his essay Lebenslauf/Werklauf, which was a somewhat fictionalized account of the artist’s life, and created much controversy, due to its blurring of fact and fiction. It was at this point that Beuy’s work became more polarizing, and his renegade philosophical and political beliefs led to his dismissal from his professorial position in 1972.\r\n\r\nMuch of Beuys most popular works were his performance and installation pieces, including “How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare” in 1965, “I Like America and America Likes Me” in 1974, and a social sculpture project that involved planting 7,000 trees in Germany. His legacy now includes dozens of exhibition all across the world, continued participation in his oak tree social sculpture, which has expanded to New York City, and growing sales of his work at auction.

in a time when Prussian was just about to claim hegemony of the other German states and dying with one of his lasts works being a medallion of Joseph Goebbels, Ludwig Manzel is confidently an artist and a piece himself of German history. He produced many sculptures in commission for the Imperial Family, including a number of historical figures, and was good friends with Kaiser Wilhelm II. He served as professor at Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin, one of his students being an \"official sculptor\" of the Third Reich Josef Thorak, and also two terms as president of the Prussian Academy of Arts. In addition to realizing his own works, Manzel was also responsible for establishing an artistic ceramics factory and bronze foundry that employed talented German sculptors to create replicas, imitations, and original pieces.\n\nManzel crafted, next to his historical, also allegorical pieces. They exemplify some French influence but are also evidently manifestations of \"true German spirit\", \"e.g., strong, heroic men and women representing the ideal of a German woman, i.e. grace and strength\". Indeed—intentional or not—many pieces tend to lack consistent titles as if a wink at their own abstractly allegorical nature. The strong woman figure bearing a mast atop the Manzelbrunnen, for example, may be named [i]Allegory of the Sea[/i], [i]Personification of Navigation[/i], [i]Sedina[/i], or rather simply [i]Manzelbrunnen[/i].\n\nOne may also find Manzel's caricatures and satirical illustrations in Berlin's magazines for which he drew in his early career as he could not live on a young sculptor's earnings alone.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Karl Ludwig

translator, art critic, and theater artist. He is considered the founder of Armenian historical painting.\r\n His paintings feature scenes from Armenian fairy-tales and various historical events.\r\nSureniants is often categorized as a realist painter. He once said that \"painters must paint life the way it appears in front of our eyes. His style reflected this notion through his depiction of landscapes and historical events. He played an instrumental role in reviving Armenian historical events through the medium of art. \r\nVardges Sureniants was born in Akhaltsikhe, Russian Empire in modern-day Georgia on 27 February 1860. His father, Hakop Sureniants, was a priest and taught religious history.\r\nThe Sureniants family then moved to Simferopol in 1868. Sureniants' father was then appointed a presbyter to the Armenian diocese in Moscow. When in Moscow, Sureniants had an opportunity to study at the prestigious Armenian Lazarian School located in the city. In 1876, he furthered his education at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture where he graduated in 1879.That same year Sureniants went to Munich, Germany where he studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts, receiving more education in painting and ultimately graduating from the academy in 1885.\r\nHe traveled to Italy in 1881 and visited the island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni where the Armenian Catholic congregation of the Mechitarists is located. In their library he studied Armenian fine art and Armenian manuscripts. He created portraits of Mikayel Chamchian and others. In 1883, he wrote his first article which was published in the Armenian newspaper Meghu Hayastani entitled \"A Few Words about Armenian Architecture\".\r\nIn 1885–87, he traveled to the Persian cities of Tabriz, Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz with Russian orientalist Valentin Zhukovski's expedition. After his travels, Sureniants translated William Shakespeare's Richard III and sent it to Constantinople so that actor Bedros Adamian could have it produced.\r\nIn 1890–91 he taught art history at the Gevorkian Seminary in Armenia.\r\nIn 1892 Sureniants visited Ani, Lake Sevan and became familiar with the everyday customs of rural Armenian life. In the same year, he went to Moscow where he became involved in many artistic circles.In 1901 an exhibition of his works was held in Baku. This was to be Sureniants' only exhibition in his lifetime. In 1901–02 he sculpted a bust of the Russian Armenian painter Ivan Aivazovsky.\r\nSureniants had one exhibition dedicated to his works in his lifetime, he was admired by many of his contemporaries which include many well-known figures in Russian and Armenian society including Martiros Saryan, Ilya Repin, and Vladimir Stasov\r\nDuring the Armenian Genocide, Sureniants painted many paintings of survivors who found refuge in Russian Armenia. In 1916 he went to Tiflis, where he and other artists such as Mardiros Saryan and Panos Terlemezian founded the Armenian Artistic Society. In 1917 Sureniants moved to Yalta where he was commissioned to draw the decorations for the newly built Armenian cathedral. Sureniants decorated the altar, walls, and dome of the church. While decorating the church Surentiants suffered a grave illness. He died on 6 April 1921, and is buried in the premises of the Armenian church of Yalta.\r\n\r\n\r\n","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Վարդգես

de Blauwer was born in the small provincial town of Ronse (Belgium). After a troubled childhood, She moved to Ghent at a young age to study painting. Later she attended the Royal Academy in Antwerp to study fashion. A study she abandoned. It was at that time she made her first collage books, actually studies and moodbooks for fashion collections. At a later age she began collecting, cutting and recycling images as therapeutic self investigation.\n\nKatrien De Blauwer calls herself a \"photographer without a camera\". She collects and recycles pictures and photos from old magazines and papers. Her work is, at the same time, intimate, directly corresponding with our unconscious, and anonymous thanks to the use of found images and body parts that have been cut away. This way, her personal history becomes the history of everyone. The collage effects a kind of universalisation, emphasizing the impossibility to identify with a single individual, yet allowing to recognize oneself in the story. The artist becomes a neutral intermediary: without being the author of the photographs, she appropriates and integrates them into her own interior world, a world she’s revealing in third person.\n\nKatrien De Blauwer gives new meaning and life to what is residual, saving images from destruction and including them in a new narration that combines intimacy and anonymity. Her work therefore deals with memory, basically. Memory by accumulation rather than by substraction. Her work brings to mind the procedures of photomontage or film editing. The cut being used as a frame that marks the essential.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Katrien De

Yuan-chia (Chinese: 李元佳; pinyin: Lǐ Yuánjiā) was a Chinese artist, poet and curator. He incorporated installations, works and photography into his art, and was one of a small number of artists of Chinese background active in the UK during his lifetime.\r\n\r\nLi Yuan-chia was one of the Ton Fan group (東方畫會) that formed in Taiwan by 1956, also known as Orient Movement or Dongfang Huahui. It is credited with establishing modern abstract art in Chinese circles. Li was one of a number of students of Li Chung-sheng (李仲生, Pinyin Li Zhongsheng) in Ton Fan, who collectively became known as the \"Eight Great Outlaws\" (八大響馬).\r\n\r\nThe group exhibited in 1957 at the São Paulo Art Biennial. In Taipei in November 1957 they held a collective exhibition, including works by Spanish painters obtained by Hsiao Chin. This was the first of 15 shows to 1971, but the group became less active because of the emigration of many of its members. A 25th anniversary show took place in 1981.\r\n\r\nLi Chung-sheng later commented on Li Yuan-chia's initial development by a facile calligraphic style, but also as an early Chinese conceptual artist.\r\n\r\nLi spent time in Italy, in Bologna and Milan; he was a founder of the Punto group, rejoining Hsiao Chin (蕭勤, Pinyin Xiao Qin), and was resident in Bologna in 1965.\r\n\r\nLi Yuan-chia moved to London in 1965 where he exhibited with David Medalla and later at the Lisson Gallery. He participated in the 1966 Signals 3 + 1 exhibition, organised by Paul Keeler and Anthony de Kedrel, with Hsiao Chin, Ho Kan, and Pia Pizzo.\r\n\r\nIn 1968 Li Yuan-chia moved to the area of Brampton (now in Cumbria) in the English-Scottish Borders. After two years residence near Lanercost, he purchased a derelict farmhouse at Banks on Hadrian's Wall from the artist Winifred Nicholson. By his own efforts and with scant resources he established the LYC Museum and Art Gallery. A local artist friend was Audrey Barker. The Museum was described by Hunter Davies in his book A Walk along the Wall, who noted among its exhibits a piece by Takis and a painting by Alfred Wallis.\r\n\r\nThe LYC exhibited artists such as Andy Goldsworthy and David Nash. Rosie Leventon, Kate Nicholson and Bill Woodrow held solo shows there during the 1980s. It also encouraged the creative efforts of children, some of whom went on to successful careers in the arts.\r\n\r\nGaining increasing recognition for his enterprise, after a year or two Li was awarded funding from the Arts Council, making it possible for the Museum to continue its activities for the ten years he had originally planned.\r\n\r\nLi Yuan-chia died of cancer. There was a 1998 memorial exhibition of his work in Taipei. A retrospective of his work and career was shown in London at the Camden Arts Centre in 2001.

Icon painter of the 17th century. Most of his creative life was spent in Zhovkva (1667 to ca 1708) where, among other things, he was one of the key figures in the Zhovkva School of Artists. Some of his work has been preserved, in whole or in part, such as the iconostases of the wooden churches in Volytsia Derevlianska (1680–2) and Volia Vysotska (1688–9); the large iconostasis of the Church of Christ's Nativity in Zhovkva (1697–9, now in the National Museum in Lviv), which is considered to be the finest Ukrainian iconostasis; and separate icons, such as Supplication (1683) from Potylych (now in the National Museum) and The Nativity of Virgin Mary (1683) from Vyzhliv. Rutkovych's treatment of religious subjects was realistic and almost secular in spirit. The emotive richness of his colors and the rhythm of his lines testify to the influence of contemporary European art on his style. Vira Svientsitska's book about Rutkovych was published in Kyiv in 1966.\r\n\r\nMaster aso worked for the royal residence that during the rule of the Jan III Sobieski contained in Zhovkva in the royal castle-palace. Working in the castle (just the name John Rutkovych was mentioned in the accounts of the royal chancellery in restoration work, copying paintings, gilding and other finishing works), he was able to benefit from the rich collection of paintings of King and learn canvases of  European artists. And, unfortunately, this page of the master remains virtually unknown.

Segal was born to Jewish parents in Iaşi, Romania, and studied at the Berlin Academy from 1892. He studied with Schmid-Reutte and Hölzel in Munich in 1896, and later studied in Paris and Italy in the early 1900s.\r\n\r\nAfter studying in Paris and Italy, he eventually moved to Berlin in 1904 where he exhibited his work with Die Brucke and Der Blaue Reiter, two leading German expressionist groups. In 1910 he co-founded the Neue Sezession, a group of artists whose work was rejected by the Berliner Sezession.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of war in 1914 he moved to Ascona, Switzerland with his family, and remained there until 1920. During the war, Switzerland became a refuge for many artists like Segal, and whilst he was there he exhibited some of his work with Arp and Dada in the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich. In 1920, he returned to Berlin, where he founded his own art school in 1923, Novembergruppe. In 1925 he was offered a teaching job in New Bauhaus in Dessau, but he declined. Because of his Jewish background he was prevented from exhibiting his work in Germany, and so in 1933 he moved to Palma, Majorca and then London, where he set up another school with his daughter Marianne. He died in London.\r\n\r\nSegal was firstly a painter, and his early work was heavily influenced by impressionism and neo-impressionism. From around 1910 he began a more expressionist style, and around 1916 found his own modern style. As well as painting, he also produced woodcuts from 1910, many of which were anti-war themed. Segal was also the author of many books, articles, and often gave lectures.\r\n\r\nHis son was the architect Walter Segal.

His greatest work, scenes of the life of Christ, were made between 1505 and 1508 on the high altar in St. Nicholai's Church in his hometown of Kalkar. In 1518, Joest worked in Cologne for the Hackeney family, before leaving, most likely for Italy, where he saw Genoa and Naples.\nJoest then returned North, and settled in Haarlem. It is possible that this is the same person as Jan Joesten van Hillegom that registered in the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1502 and who made a painting of St. Willibrord and St. Bavo for the Egmond Abbey. The last edition of Adriaen van der Willingen's work of Haarlem painters mentions the burial of an artist there called \"Jan Joosten\" in 1519.\nJoest has been compared to David and Memling, but he more properly belongs to the school of Scorel. One of the features of Joest's work is the exquisite transparency of his coloring and the subtle and delicate modelling of the faces. Twenty panels painted by him can be seen in the church at Kalkar. Other works attributed to Joest are in Wesel and Rees, as well as the \"Death of the Virgin\" in and \"Life of Kleitz\" Munich.\nJan Joest was practically unknown until 1874, when Canon Wolff and Dr. Eisenmann, established his identity.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Jan Joest van Calcar","relatedArtists":["57726d7fedc2cb3880b481c6","57726d8cedc2cb3880b49dc0","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa61","57726d87edc2cb3880b49271","57726d97edc2cb3880b4b158","57726d95edc2cb3880b4ae9b","5978dfe5edc2c98ad0bb50f1","57726d83edc2cb3880b48822","57726d8aedc2cb3880b49857","57726d81edc2cb3880b48431","57726d80edc2cb3880b482bd","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ab7b","57726d8cedc2cb3880b49e1c","57726d89edc2cb3880b497c1","57726d97edc2cb3880b4b16c","57726ddbedc2cb3880b52093","57726d83edc2cb3880b487c4","57726d8bedc2cb3880b49a35","57726d91edc2cb3880b4a7ae","57726d93edc2cb3880b4a9be"]},{"id":"5c9ffbb6edc2c925107b8347","artistName":"Archibald Motley","url":"archibald-motley","lastNameFirst":"Motley Archibald","birthDay":"/Date(-2468880000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(348451200000)/","birthDayAsString":"c.October 7, 1891","deathDayAsString":"c.January 16, 1981","image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00231/images/archibald-motley/web-ar-motley-replace-one-900x607.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Motley","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e29","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e41"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1918,"activeYearsCompletion":1981,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f504","5a3e7ff4edc2c9cfcc4208a7","57726dc3edc2cb3880b4fac1","5c2377caedc2c90d24420d33","5a3bfaf6edc2c9c834cb9a20","57726dc3edc2cb3880b4faa5","57726dd9edc2cb3880b51d88"]},{"id":"5ca03182edc2c92510a3e1d3","artistName":"Vladimir Tretchikoff","url":"vladimir-tretchikoff","lastNameFirst":"Tretchikoff Vladimir","birthDay":"/Date(-1767744000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1156550400000)/","birthDayAsString":"December 26, 1913","deathDayAsString":"August 26, 2006","image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00231/images/vladimir-tretchikoff/at244945002.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tretchikoff","dictionaries":["57726a68edc2ca38801d4f91","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71f0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1937,"activeYearsCompletion":2006,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Владимир Третчиков","relatedArtists":["57726d7dedc2cb3880b47d76","57726dc7edc2cb3880b5007a","57726dcdedc2cb3880b50b7c","5c40e733edc2c91f90e19866","57cd0c87edc2c99704d99df1","57726da0edc2cb3880b4c2ef","57726de6edc2cb3880b53298","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d782","57726dd2edc2cb3880b512a8","59ee5b25edc2c918f45d4c4f","5911d2a7edc2c94250ba119d","59bb9a31edc2c98e1401fdde","5799aab6edc2c986dc90e4b1","59bb84b7edc2c98e14a35ec1","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d7d3","595d3efcedc2c9514ce2bdde","5a8d2a32edc2c9fc9ccfcf54","5c4cc89aedc2c92f90da5d6a","5bbd5497edc2c91a80659689"]},{"id":"57e416bcedc2cd7734cd5458","artistName":"William Russell Flint","url":"sir-william-russell-flint","lastNameFirst":"Sir William Russell Flint 300","birthDay":"/Date(-2832019200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-172800000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 4, 1880","deathDayAsString":"December 30, 1969","image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00098/images//sir-william-russell-flint-300.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Russell_Flint","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e8","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d29","57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["57726dadedc2cb3880b4d6ee","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ace3","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e804","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aaec","57726df7edc2cb3880b54c1d","578621d3edc2cc202cae9b86","57726dffedc2cb3880b557c1","5a3a99a7edc2c934343305ee","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a7fb","5b2fa0c4edc2c9216864c3ed","57726de5edc2cb3880b53180","57726d8aedc2cb3880b4995d","57726dddedc2cb3880b52505","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e494","57726da5edc2cb3880b4ca2b","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f518","5a155491edc2c996f4521dc1","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aac0","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ac6c","57726db2edc2cb3880b4df09"]},{"id":"57726de5edc2cb3880b53166","artistName":"O.

Ngai grew up in British colonized Hong Kong before enrolling in Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 2006. She shortened her name to \"Victo\" from \"Victoria\" - a name she considers leftover from the British colonization of Hong Kong. \n\nUntil the age of 6, Ngai would be plagued by fevers that induced near-fatal seizures. With nowhere else to turn, Ngai's mother turned to herbal treatments to cure her. It was at this point that Ngai's mother recognized her daughter's artistic talent, and so, she took Ngai to a private art teacher in Shenzen. Ngai would build incredibly on her skills and in 2006 she applied, and was accepted, into RISD, the only school she applied to. At RISD, Ngai was heavily inspired by her professor, editorial illustrator, Chris Buzelli. Initially, Ngai struggled in Buzelli's editorial course, but when Buzelli had encouraged her to pursue the incredible line-work displayed in her sketchbooks, Ngai had an artistic breakthrough. Her work and signature neo-surrealistic style would soon become instantly recognizable to anyone who saw it. \n\nIn Ngai's junior year of college, she landed her first client-[i]PLANSPONSOR Magazine[/i], art directed by SooJin Buzelli. Ngai's second client would be [i]The New York Times[/i]. Ngai would soon land several major clients including [i]The New Yorker[/i], [I]NBC[/I], [I]Dreamworks[/i], [i]Penguin Random House[/i], [i]Simon & Schuster[/i], [i]Apple[/i], and [i]American Express[/i]. \n\nCurrently, Ngai works freelance out of Los Angeles. She taught at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York City, and recently won gold for advertising at the Society of Illustrator's 61.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"倪傳婧","relatedArtists":["57726d7eedc2cb3880b47fec","57726d86edc2cb3880b49169","57726d8aedc2cb3880b498e3","5b3d37c8edc2c92414cbacf5","5ac90a8dedc2c9d018749aed","5c51d776edc2c92af8739a2e","59a20219edc2c99d709d5a63","5ba922b6edc2c91ad0e4163c","5c054c5fedc2c92768d98fbd"]},{"id":"5cae3203edc2c96008b9db28","artistName":"Oliver Mark","url":"oliver-mark","lastNameFirst":"Mark Oliver","birthDay":"/Date(-216604800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"February 20, 1963","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00232/images/oliver-mark/576f1fbb123e3c37c7f21b28274ccd0b.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Mark","dictionaries":["57726a68edc2ca38801d4f59","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7248","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ed8","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Oliver Mark is a German photographer and artist known primarily for his portraits of international celebrities.\n\nIn the 1990s, Mark began photographing celebrities.

His work run parallel to that of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-michel-basquiat]Jean-Michel Basquiat[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/kenny-scharf]Kenny Scharf[/url], and other 1980s artists and engages with a variety of media and techniques, such as drawing, painting, body art, graffiti. Haring produced monumental public works that contributed to bringing recognition to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/street-art#!#resultType:masonry]Street art[/url] and to its entrance into museums. \n\nHaring’s signature style is based on abstract, stylized forms worked into interlocking human figures and tightly arranged patterns. He used few basic colors in hyper-saturated hues, applied as flat areas of paint and shaped into thick silhouettes. He gave his works a distinctively graphic, cartoonish quality and relied on repetitive motifs in creating a visual commentary of both his private experiences and the larger culture of his time. Haring, indeed, sought inspiration for his artistic practice in the popular culture that surrounded him, from New York’s hip-hop scene to Disney's cartoons, and also engaged with the main social and political issues of his time, such as the AIDS epidemic, South African apartheid, and the American conservative politics of the 1890s. \n\nHaring was born in Reading, Pennsylvania in 1958. He took up painting and drawing at an early age and moved to New York in 1978 in search for artistic inspiration, after dropping out of a commercial art school. In New York, he attended the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/school-of-visual-arts-sva-new-york-city-ny-us#!#resultType:masonry]School of Visual Arts[/url], where he was exposed to the avant-garde propositions of the city’s vibrant artistic scene. He first experimented with a variety of media, producing performance pieces and painted environments in the technique of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/action-painting#!#resultType:masonry]action painting[/url]. A series of drawings from 1978-1979, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/untitled-1978-2][i]Untitled[/i][/url] (1978) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/untitled-1979-0][i]Untitled[/i][/url] (1979) exemplifies Haring’s early interest in the exploration of abstract shapes interacting with vigorous, gestural markings within a carefully bordered space. These first experiments will lead to the creation of a distinctive style dominated by linearity, patterns, easily legible subject matters, a bright palette, and absolute freedom of expression. In 1980, he also moved towards figuration. His most recurring subjects include dancing human figures, crawling babies, barking dogs, flying saucers, pyramids, heart motifs, and other familiar elements. \n\nThe artistic tendencies of New York in 1980s provided Haring with a vibrant framework for the elaboration of his own artistic practice. His Street art works, which he began to make in 1982, include white-chalk drawings on sheets of black paper used to cover old advertisements and other surfaces in New York’s subway stations. He also actively engaged with the political scenario of his time. His cut-ups from 1980, collages of fake newspaper headlines, as well as his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/all-works#!#filterName:Series_subway-drawings-1982,resultType:masonry][i]Subway Drawings[/i][/url] (1982) commented on and blatantly attacked Ronald Reagan’s policies and the Catholic Church. Haring’s artistic vision was also influenced by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-dubuffet]Jean Dubuffet[/url]’s art theory and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-henri]Robert Henri[/url]’s manifesto [i]The Art Spirit[/i] (1923), which advocated creative freedom and the right to self-expression as the main driving forces in an artist’s work. These ideas are also evident in Haring’s lifelong commitment to the creation of a truly public art that was a direct and unmediated expression of his own feelings, easily understood by the audience.\n\nHaring was an active participant in New York’s counterculture and completely immersed himself in the music and dance scene of DJs, hip-hop, and break dance. The element of improvisation, the pulsating rhythm and moves of hip-hop particularly attracted Haring, who transcribed these elements directly into his compositions and figures. Many of Haring’s human subjects can in fact be seen performing specific hip-hop and break-dance moves, such as head spins, the so-called “electric boogies”, which entailed dancers standing up and moving their hands and bodies in a  robot-like manner, and other moves performed closer to the floor, involving thrusting bodies balancing on one hand. Some of the works that best exemplify the style and themes of Haring’s production are [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/free-south-africa-1985][i]Free South Africa[/i][/url] (1985) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/crack-is-wack-1986][i]Crack is Wack[/i][/url] (1986). Fluorescent colors and thick, black lines shaped into silhouettes dominate these works. Haring surrounds the contours of his figures with thick markings and lightning bolts that emphasize the movement of the dancers and their physical interactions, which always take place on a single plane in a completely bi-dimensional space. His figures are engaged in intricate exchanges and gestures, with bent, interlocking limbs shaped into angular patterns that also recall the art of ancient Egypt. In these works, human bodies are densely arranged in rhythmic compositions, creating an overall visual effect of abstract, hyper-decorated surface.\n\nIn 1982, the artist held his first important solo gallery exhibition at the [i]Tony Shafrazi Gallery[/i] in Soho and received an invitation to participate to [i]Documenta[/i], one of the most important venues for contemporary artists in the world. From 1984 to 1986, he gained increasing international recognition and critical attention. During these years, he showed his works in different galleries, including [i]Leo Castelli Gallery[/i] in New York, [i]Robert Fraser Gallery[/i] in London, and [i]Galerie Watari[/i] in Tokyo, and worked on a series of public art projects around the world, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/water-window-mural-at-the-national-gallery-of-victoria-1984]painting a mural at the Melbourne National Gallery of Victoria[/url] (1984), creating backdrops and costumes for contemporary ballets, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/all-works#!#filterName:Series_secret-pastures-1984,resultType:masonry][i]Secret Pastures[/i][/url] (1984),  and designing a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/dont-be-a-litter-pig-logos-1984]logo for an anti-litter campaign[/url] for the city of New York. This extremely varied string of commissions, which were often linked to humanitarian causes that Haring particularly cared about, contributed to establishing his style as iconic and recognizable. In 1986, he opened his own Pop Shop in Manhattan, selling merchandise and items decorated with his own characteristic images. In the same year, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum invited him to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/berlin-mural-1986]paint on the Berlin Wall[/url].\n\nThe desire to create art with the purpose of enriching the life of different communities was central to Haring’s life and career until a few months before his death in 1990, which took place in New York due to AIDS-related complications. Many of his works, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/ignorance-fear-1989][i]Ignorance=Fear[/i][/url] (1989) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/stop-aids-1989][i]Stop AIDS[/i][/url] (1989), actively engaged with the AIDS epidemic, seeking to raise awareness and eliminate the stigma attached to the disease. In [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/safe-sex-1988][i]Safe Sex[/i][/url] (1988), the artist promoted disease prevention by candidly and effectively depicting a scene of homosexual love-making in his usual cartoonish and hyper-colourful style. His final work was the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/fight-aids-worldwide-1990-0]design of a stamp and envelop[/url] commissioned by the Word Federation of United Nations Associations to illustrate the association’s commitment to the fight against AIDS. Haring’s public art still resonates powerfully in contemporary culture, thanks to its recognizable style, unique embrace of the most joyous aspects of human experience, and the intense engagement with political and social realities.\n\n\n[i]by Caterina Franciosi[/i]","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Keith

They were extensively used to depict religious subjects on the interior of churches within the Empire and remained a popular form of expression from 6th century to the end of the Empire in the 15th century. After the fall of the Empire, many mosaics underwent destruction but many remained well-preserved and are extant to this day. The mosaic art of the Byzantine Empire exerted a significant influence on the Muslim art during the Omayyad and Abbasid caliphate and later in the time of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/ottoman-period#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Ottoman Empire[/url].\n\nMosaics were initially used to depict religious figures such as Christ as well as different scenes from the Bible.The Emperor Constantine adopted Christianity and in 330 moved his capital from Rome to Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), at the eastern frontier of the Roman Empire. Christianity flourished and gradually supplanted the Greco-Roman gods that had once defined Roman religion and culture. This religious shift dramatically affected the art that was created across the empire. Subsequently, the mosaics came to depict non-religious subjects as well. \n\nConstantinople was the richest repository of Byzantine mosaics throughout the Empire’s history. The city was sacked in the 13th century and many notable buildings damaged. These buildings, including the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/byzantine-mosaics/all-works#!#filterName:Series_hagia-sophia-istanbul-turkey,resultType:masonry]Hagia Sophia[/url] church, the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/byzantine-mosaics/all-works#!#filterName:Series_pammakaristos-church-istanbul-turkey,resultType:masonry]Pammakaristos Monastery[/url], were restored later in the century and embellished with a new set of mosaics. Notable examples of original Byzantine mosaics of this period include those used in the decoration of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/byzantine-mosaics/all-works#!#filterName:Series_chora-church-istanbul-turkey,resultType:masonry]Chora Church[/url] in Constantinople.\n\nBy the time of Justinian’s reign in the 6th century, mosaics were being commissioned directly by the Emperor himself as well as the top bureaucracy. During Justinian’s rule, Italy came under the Byzantine rule and Justinian made the city of Ravenna his administrative centre. It was during this period that many grand structures were built in the city and these buildings were adorned with exquisite mosaics. These include the mosaics in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/byzantine-mosaics/all-works#!#filterName:Series_san-vitale-ravenna-italy,resultType:masonry]Church of San Vitale[/url], and the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/byzantine-mosaics/all-works#!#filterName:Series_basilica-of-sant-apollinare-in-classe-ravenna-italy,resultType:masonry]Basilica of Sant-Apollinare[/url]. The earliest of these mosaics in Ravenna were commissioned directly by Justinian or his wife. But the trend continued over subsequent centuries and many iconic mosaics of Ravenna date to 7th century.\n\nDuring the 8th century, the Byzantine rulers decreed the use of any icons to be heretic. This included the depiction of religious figures which had been the dominant theme of Byzantine mosaics in previous centuries. As a consequence, many of the mosaics created during the previous centuries were destroyed during this period. After the ban on icons was lifted in the Empire, the creation of mosaics underwent a rapid revival. It was during this period from the 9th to 11th centuries that some of the most magnificent Byzantine mosaics were created. Most notable examples of mosaics during this period were made on the interior of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/byzantine-mosaics/all-works#!#filterName:Series_hosios-loukas-monastery-distomo-greece,resultType:masonry]Hosios Loukas Monastery[/url] as well as the Nea Moni Monastery. \n\nBetween 1204 and 1261, the Byzantine Empire suffered another crisis: the Latin Occupation. Crusaders from Western Europe invaded and captured Constantinople in 1204, temporarily toppling the empire in an attempt to bring the eastern empire back into the fold of western Christendom. By 1261 the Byzantine Empire was free of its western occupiers and stood as an independent empire once again, albeit markedly weakened. The breadth of the empire had shrunk, and so had its power. Nevertheless Byzantium survived until the Ottomans took Constantinople in 1453. In spite of this period of diminished wealth and stability, the arts continued to flourish in the Late Byzantine period, much as it had before. Byzantine art and culture continued to live on in its far-reaching outposts, as well as in Greece, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire, where it had flourished for so long. The Russian Empire, which was first starting to emerge around the time Constantinople fell, carried on as the heir of Byzantium. Similarly, in Italy, when the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/early-renaissance#!#resultType:masonry]Renaissance[/url] was first emerging, it borrowed heavily from the traditions of Byzantium. \n\nby [url href=http://www.medievalchronicles.com/medieval-history/medieval-history-periods/byzantine-empire/byzantine-mosaics/]Medieval Chronicles[/url] and [url

MARTIN\n(1930-2010)\n​\nLinde Martin is a great American master, she was featured in the books like Best of oil paintings 1996, Best inspirational of 1997, Who is who in the west, 1997/1998. Her originality, creativity, style and experimentation is so visually stunning it defies contemporary methods of modern abstract painting. Her work is distinctive, awe inspiring and genuinely heartwarming for art lovers in America and beyond..\n\nLinde Martin's own words:\n \nMy work has been described as a palette for the viewer to create and see with. The abstract style lends itself to your projections and symbols. In the sweeps, arcs, and shafts of layered color, you will see what you need to see - a woman, a forest fire, a desert canyon, the wheel of time, even the gods.\n\nFor me, creativity and art are about sharing. Both the viewer and the painter create together. We undertake a journey of courage and surrender when we look into the canvas. It is the same for me as I paint. I open myself to flow and force of the creative energy of the universe and the work just flows! Our task, or challenge, as adults is to rediscover our own boundless creativity and relearn how to see.\n\nI use abstract painting as a language to communicate our shared experience and to bring us together as one. The abstraction on the canvas really exists somewhere on this Earth, and we can recognize it. Some people, standing before an abstract painting, will know immediately \"what is it,\" while others will take longer to recognize it. And of course, they are seeing their own personal symbols and images.\n\nI invite you to go into the canvas, and into yourself to see and experience all the wonder, beauty, emotion, and spirit that are there. Even the greatest art is just poor imitation of the divine in the end we have to go to the true source.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Linde B Martin","relatedArtists":["57726db3edc2cb3880b4e10e","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e62a","57726de4edc2cb3880b5304c","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4bf46","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c8fd","5be1d849edc2c906e4ccdc33","57726dbcedc2cb3880b4ef73","57726dd7edc2cb3880b51a3f","57726decedc2cb3880b53b74","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e614","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f3bc","58dc9cdaedc2c91098cdba62","5a539ad4edc2c9e57867ba82","5832c86bedc2c9ba7804f3e9","57726ddfedc2cb3880b52880","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e6f2","5b04c908edc2c900b89e67fe","5a038781edc2c9b2ec8ae570","57726dc9edc2cb3880b504d2","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c81b"]},{"id":"57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bd0f","artistName":"Lee Krasner","url":"lee-krasner","lastNameFirst":"Krasner Lee","birthDay":"/Date(-1930694400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(456451200000)/","birthDayAsString":"October 27, 1908","deathDayAsString":"June 19, 1984","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/a83556ad-7f8f-4097-8158-2fc4e2c6f37d.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Krasner","dictionaries":["5804eadaedc2ce45b4e01a76","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d81","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e69","57726b4bedc2cb3880ad67f8","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Lee Krasner was an influential American abstract expressionist painter in the second half of the 20th century. On October 25, 1945, she married artist Jackson Pollock, who was also influential in the abstract expressionism movement.\r\n\r\nKrasner was born as Lena Krassner (outside the family she was known as Lenore Krasner) in Brooklyn, New York to Russian Jewish immigrant parents from Bessarabia.\r\n\r\nShe studied at The Cooper Union and the National Academy of Design, and worked on the WPA Federal Art Project from 1935 to 1943. Starting in 1937, she took classes with Hans Hofmann, who taught the principles of cubism, and his influence helped to direct Krasner's work toward neo-cubist abstraction. When commenting on her work, Hofmann stated, \"This is so good you would not know it was painted by a woman.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1940, she started showing her works with the American Abstract Artists, a group of American painters.\r\n\r\nKrasner would often cut apart her own drawings and paintings to create collages and, at times, revised or discarded an entire series. As a result, her surviving body of work is relatively small. Her catalogue raisonné, published in 1995 by Abrams, lists only 599 known pieces. She was rigorously self-critical, and her critical eye is believed to have been important to Pollock's work.\r\n\r\nKrasner struggled with the public's reception of her identity, both as a woman and as the wife of Pollock. Therefore she often signed her works with the genderless initials \"L.K.\" instead of her more recognizable full name.\r\n\r\nKrasner and Pollock gave each other reassurance and support during a period when neither's work was well-appreciated. Like Picasso during the brief period of his interaction with Braque, the daily give-and-take of Pollock and Krasner stimulated both artists. Pollock and Krasner fought a battle for legitimacy, impulsiveness and individual expression. They opposed an old-fashioned, conformist, and repressed culture unreceptive to these values, which was put off by the intricacy of Modernism in general.\r\n\r\nLee Krasner died in 1984, age 75, from natural causes. She had been suffering from arthritis.

The Lowbrow art movement developed in the late 1970s in the Los Angeles underground scene. It was inspired by different forms of street and popular culture, such as underground comix, cartoons, tiki culture and punk rock. Ryden was born in 1963 in Oregon but was raised in Southern California. In 1987, he graduated from the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/art-center-college-of-design-pasadena-ca-us#!#resultType:masonry]Art Center College of Design[/url] in Pasadena, California and began his career as a commercial artist. In his early career, Ryden found success by creating many iconic album covers for famous musicians such as Michael Jackson’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-ryden/michael-jackson-s-dangerous-1991][i]Dangerous[/i][/url] (1991). \n\nRyden began the transition from commercial to fine art when his work was discovered by artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-williams]Robert Williams[/url], who featured Ryden’s painting on the cover of [i]Juxtapoz[/i], a magazine devoted to Lowbrow art. Ryden made his debut as a fine artist in his 1998 solo show “[i]The Meat Show[/i]” in Pasadena, California. In his artist statement, Ryden explained his creative process through a story of about a magic monkey that comes to him at night with inspiration: “[i]I have to switch my brain from linear, logical thinking to creative free feeling… Things have to flow from a place that is subconscious and uninhibited[/i]”. The artist advances this surrealist strategy by choosing to paint subjects loaded with cultural connotations. He seeks out inspiration from various sources: art history, antiques and collectibles, religious imagery, popular culture and childhood memories. This approach is realized in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-ryden/the-birth-of-venus-1998][i]The Birth of Venus[/i][/url] (1998), which depicts Colonel Sanders as a midwife to Abraham Lincoln, who is giving birth to baby Venus from his cheek. Making the scene even stranger is Jesus in the sky blessing the baby and a nurse presenting a slab of meat to Lincoln. The rich details that make up this surreal scene are cryptic and amusing, humorous and disturbing. Ryden opens his imagery to endless connotations and interpretations, and encourages the viewer to find new meanings in his paintings. Another element in Ryden’s work is the connection to pop and celebrity culture as evident in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-ryden/leonardo-dicaprio-1998][i]Leonardo DiCaprio[/i][/url] (1998) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-ryden/christina-1998][i]Christina[/i][/url] (1998) - a portrait of Hollywood actress Christina Ricci. \n\nIn subsequent exhibitions, Ryden addressed new themes: the 2004 “[i]Wondertoonel[/i]” explored the concept of a cabinet of curiosities, the 2007 “[i]The Tree Show[/i]” dealt with the natural world through the motif of the tree and the 2009 “[i]The Snow Yak Show[/i]” centered around snow and ice. At the same time, themes like meat, bunnies, bees and Abraham Lincoln seem to be of particular important in Ryden’s art, making frequent appearance in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-ryden/the-butcher-bunny-2000][i]The Butcher Bunny[/i][/url] (2000) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-ryden/grinder-2010][i]Grinder[/i][/url] (2010). Sometimes, Ryden further enhances the ornate and dramatic qualities of his paintings by creating custom made frames: Grinder, a painting that references the idealism and sentimentalism of the 1890s is decorated accordingly with a 19th century style wooden frame. Recently, the artist was commissioned to create the set and design for the production [i]Whipped Cream[/i] performed by the American Ballet Theatre.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Mark Ryden","relatedArtists":["57726d7fedc2cb3880b48098","57726d80edc2cb3880b482a5","5a8e0d62edc2c976347197f9","57726e01edc2cb3880b55c56","57991d2aedc2c905e02a156e","57726debedc2cb3880b53a07","58d92d6eedc2cf82e062f427","57726da7edc2cb3880b4ce86","57726dd5edc2cb3880b5177d","599125ebedc2c96e748fc498","57726db2edc2cb3880b4e025","5a34fdb2edc2c9cae090015a","57726da3edc2cb3880b4c6ae","58e5865eedc2c98c788f5455","57726de8edc2cb3880b53578","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a1c5","5a337af4edc2c93c9c9d7fc0","57726de5edc2cb3880b53135","5beade5cedc2c920c8b0a7f1","57726d95edc2cb3880b4ae1b"]},{"id":"5d03372eedc2c93d244ef177","artistName":"Antonio de La Gándara","url":"antonio-de-la-gandara","lastNameFirst":"de La Gándara Antonio","birthDay":"/Date(-3409516800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-1656979200000)/","birthDayAsString":"December 16, 1861","deathDayAsString":"June 30, 1917","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00240/images//antonio-de-la-gandara-self-portrait.png!Portrait.png","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_de_La_G%C3%A1ndara","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d41","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d29"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["57726d8aedc2cb3880b4986f","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a8e0","57726d9aedc2cb3880b4b67c","57726d9aedc2cb3880b4b738","57726dfcedc2cb3880b55439","57726d81edc2cb3880b48413","57726dfcedc2cb3880b553b6","57726dc9edc2cb3880b50412","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4ee25","5a346e1cedc2c96bf476e59f","57726d96edc2cb3880b4af6d","57726d7eedc2cb3880b47e13","57726d89edc2cb3880b49765","5790b15dedc2c9142434e2f1","587fee9fedc2c98c2858174b","57726d96edc2cb3880b4b00a","57726dfeedc2cb3880b55618","57726dc9edc2cb3880b5055c","5a0ebd7bedc2c9cbac67f585","57726d95edc2cb3880b4aedb"]},{"id":"5acd3ff0edc2c927604e3a51","artistName":"Vincent Amicosante","url":"vincent-amicosante","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(-566784000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"January 16, 1952","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00181/images/vincent-amicosante/amicosante-medium-square.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":[],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Vincent Amicosante’s paintings have been exhibited throughout the United States, including The Cape Cod Museum of Art, The Cahoon Museum in Cotuit, MA, the Provincetown Art Association and Museum, the Cotuit Center for the Arts and the Harmon Gallery in Wellfleet, MA.

A year after the completion of her degree, her lifelong fascination with the world of jewelry led her to the European Centre of Gemology and Jewelry at the University of Oviedo where she studied gemology, jewelry manufacturing, wax molding, gemstonesetting and jewelry design, which she would later perfect in Italy.\nThe ensuing courses in diamonds, colored stones and pearls, as well as those of jewelry appraisal, would give her the credentials to pursue her career as a jewelry designer and appraiser.\nShe launched her first jewelry collection in 1991, introducing herself to a clientele that immediately vested their trust in her, not only for her designs but also for the appraisal of their most personal pieces of jewelry. Hence, she successfully brought together her two passions: design and gemology.\nIn 1991 she, along with a group of gemologists and appraisers, founded the Spanish Jewelry Appraisers’ Association (A.E.T.A.) and later served as its president.\n\nShortly thereafter, she would expand her professional horizons by collaborating with others in the sector. In January 2000, she joined forces with Spain’s premier international jewelry brand, Carrera y Carrera, on a major project to modernize and re-position the brand. As the Director of Fine Jewelry at Carrera y Carrera, she launched the “Garden of Roses” collection in New York in July 2002, the success of which enhanced her reputation and stature internationally.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"HRH Princess Miriam of Bulgaria, The Princess of Tirnovo (Doña Miriam de Ungría y López)","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726da6edc2cb3880b4cc7f","artistName":"Robert Morris","url":"robert-morris","lastNameFirst":"Morris Robert","birthDay":"/Date(-1227398400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1543363200000)/","birthDayAsString":"February 9, 1931","deathDayAsString":"November 28, 2018","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/ad373836-5c02-49cf-b0ed-b7786a458007.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_%28artist%29","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f69","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f71"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Robert Morris is an American sculptor, conceptual artist and writer.

His early works anticipates many elements of minimalism, which is why he is also considered by some a minimalist, although most of his later artworks are not strictly minimalist.\r\n\r\nStella was born in Malden, Massachusetts, to parents of Italian descent. After attending high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, he attended Princeton University, where he majored in history and met Darby Bannard and Michael Fried. Early visits to New York art galleries influenced his artist development, and his work was influenced by the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline. Stella moved to New York in 1958, after his graduation. He is one of the most well-regarded postwar American painters still working today. Frank Stella has reinvented himself in consecutive bodies of work over the course of his five-decade career. Notably, he is heralded for creating abstract paintings that bear no pictorial illusions or psychological or metaphysical references in twentieth-century painting.\r\n\r\nUpon moving to New York City, he reacted against the expressive use of paint by most painters of the abstract expressionist movement, instead finding himself drawn towards the \"flatter\" surfaces of Barnett Newman's work and the \"target\" paintings of Jasper Johns. He began to produce works which emphasized the picture-as-object, rather than the picture as a representation of something, be it something in the physical world, or something in the artist's emotional world. Stella married Barbara Rose, later a well-known art critic, in 1961. Around this time he said that a picture was \"a flat surface with paint on it - nothing more\". Later he introduced more colors and relief to his paintings, while also moving towards „shaped canvas” painting.\r\n\r\nThe Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a retrospective of Stella’s work in 1970, making him the youngest artist to receive one. Stella’s work was included in several important exhibitions that defined 1960s art, among them the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum’s The Shaped Canvas (1965) and Systemic Painting (1966). His art has been the subject of several retrospectives in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Among the many honors he has received was an invitation from Harvard University to give the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures in 1984. In 2009, Frank Stella was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama. Stella continues to live and work in New York. He also remains active in protecting the rights for artists.

A work of art can capture all of the beauty and pain of life, and hold onto it. For her, art brings personal growth: \"I can step back from my creation and uncover deeper layers of myself. This expanded vision inspires my future work and my teaching. If a viewer can identify him or herself, or make a connection with my art, then the viewer can believe that what is felt is real and justified. Art brings faith, and faith is what we all are searching. Through art, people find their own inner peace and envision or become aware of a better place for themselves in this world.\"\n\n\nProfessional Associations\n\nMember of the Art Renewal Center,

Longhi was a Venetian painter, who mastered the portrayal of scenes of everyday Venetian life. Born Pietro Falca, he changed his last name to Longhi when he began painting. As a child, his father encouraged his natural talent for drawing, and he later studied under the acclaimed history painter Antonio Balestra in Verona. Like his early mentor, Longhi began his painting career with history paintings, depicting grand historical themes. After the unsuccessful reception of his painting Fall of the Giants, Longhi transitioned to painting small interior scenes under the tutelage of a painter of contemporary life, Giuseppe Maria Crespi, turning to them completely by 1741. Rather than paint the vast architectural glory of Venice or decorative schemes like his contemporaries, Longhi became the chronicler of contemporary Venetian life. A such, almost all of his paintings were outside of the mainstream of Venetian art, which was filled with grand historical and religious cycles. \r\n\r\nLonghi was extremely popular during his lifetime, painting bright scenes with a light social comedy. Many show Venetians at play, and chronicle the daily activities of a typical Venetian citizen, such as going to the barber’s, duck hunting, gambling, or watching an exhibition at the zoo. Longhi was also a very accomplished draftsman, and many of his drawings are beautiful for their own sake. Many of the drawings were not done as sketches for future paintings, but for the artist’s own enjoyment. \r\n\r\nNot only a painter, Longhi also taught drawing and painting for much of his life, and founded an academy of painting and engraving. His legacy also includes both a chronicle of daily Venetian life though his paintings, as well as his son Alessandro Longhi, who was an accomplished artist in his own right.

After graduating secondary school, he traveled to St. Petersburg to study at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts as an unenrolled student, working as a book illustrator to support himself. In order to help pay the bills, he also taught art to the children of Grand Duke Vladimir. At his first exhibition, in 1889, he changed his surname, Rosenberg, which he was concerned would sound too Jewish and bad for business, to a shorter version of his mother’s maiden name Baxter: Bakst. \r\n\r\nHe began exhibiting in the 1890’s with the Society of Watercolorists, as he continued his studies at the Academie Julian, making important connections with prominent artists. In the late 1890’s he founded, along with Sergei Diaghilev, the Mir Iskusstva, or “World of Art,” movement. He illustrated many graphics for their publication, drawing him praise and popularity. Until the end of the century, he continued to paint and receive commissions, from as high up as Tsar Nichols II himself. \r\n\r\nBy 1909, he was mainly producing stage and costume designs, at first for Greek tragedies and then with Diaghilev’s Ballet Russes, a prominent ballerina group. Due to his Jewish religion, he was exiled from living in St. Petersburg, and was prohibited from living anywhere outside the pale of settlement, and so mainly resided in Western Europe. His set designs, along with those of Alexandre Benois, are recognized as revolutionizing stage design. \r\n \r\nBakst died in 1924 of lung problems, having broken with the Ballet Russes and Diaghilev in 1918, although he continued to paint.

Rippl-Rónai was a Hungarian painter. He first introduced modern artistic movements in the Hungarian art.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Kaposvár. After his studies at the High School there, he went to study in Budapest, where he obtained a degree in pharmacology. In 1884 he travelled to Munich to study painting at the Academy. Two years later he obtained a grant which enabled him to move to Paris and study with Munkácsy, the most important Hungarian realist painter. In 1888 he met the members of Les Nabis and under their influence he painted his first important work, The Inn at Pont-Aven, a deeply-felt work notable for its dark atmosphere. His first big success was his painting My Grandmother (1894). He also painted in a portrait of Hungarian pianist and composer Zdenka Ticharich (1921).\r\n\r\nLater he returned to Hungary, where critical reception was at first lukewarm, but he eventually had a very successful exhibition entitled \"Rippl-Rónai Impressions 1890-1900\". He believed that for an artist not only is his body of work significant, but also his general modus vivendi, even including the clothes he wore. He thus became interested in design, which led to commissions such as the dining room and the entire furnishings of the Andrássy palace, and a stained-glass window in the Ernst Museum, (both in Budapest). Between 1911 and 1913 his exhibitions in Frankfurt, Munich and Vienna were highly successful. His last major work, a portrait of his friend Zorka, was painted in 1919, and in 1927 he died at his home, the Villa Roma in Kaposvár.

In 1968 he joined the Arte Povera movement, embodying actions or ideas through combinations of contrasting and opposed materials (that didn't involved industrial process, which is why the movement was called Arte Povera, \"poor art\"), whose weight, gravity and vigour he explored. In 1972 he turned to words and their immateriality to explore the relationship between abstract categories of thought, such as general and particular, finite and infinite, culture and nature, the passing of historical time and the hypothesis of the eternity of universal physical laws, the routine of experience and the abstraction of philosophical principles. He took part in Documenta 5 and 7, organized at Kassel in 1972 and in 1982. In 1990 he was awarded the Leone d’Oro for painting at the 44th Venice Biennale. His striving for a universal energy and an idea of infinity led the artist to represent actions of approach and communication between different realities in sculptures which express a compressed force, blocked “at the limit”, at a moment of balance. The Museo d'Arte Moderna in Bologna (MamBo) held in 2006 a wide-ranging anthological exhibition conceived by the artist as a total work. He lives and works in Turin and on the island of Stromboli.

Hugo produced more than 4000 drawings. Originally pursued as a casual hobby, drawing became more important to Hugo shortly before his exile, when he made the decision to stop writing in order to devote himself to politics. Drawing became his exclusive creative outlet during the period 1848–1851. Hugo worked only on paper, and on a small scale; usually in dark brown or black pen-and-ink wash, sometimes with touches of white, and rarely with color. The surviving drawings are surprisingly accomplished and \"modern\" in their style and execution, foreshadowing the experimental techniques of Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. He kept his artwork out of the public eye, fearing it would overshadow his literary work. However, he enjoyed sharing his drawings with his family and friends, often in the form of ornately handmade calling cards, many of which were given as gifts to visitors when he was in political exile. Some of his work was shown to, and appreciated by, contemporary artists such as Van Gogh and Delacroix; the latter expressed the opinion that if Hugo had decided to become a painter instead of a writer, he would have outshone the artists of their century.

transformative early-20th century; he was one of its archetypes. Demuth was a principal member of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/precisionism#!#resultType:masonry]Precisionism[/url], the first indigenous modern art movement in the United States. Challenging the boundaries of race, class, sexuality, and artistic tradition, he digested the shifting social landscape around him and left behind a memorable body of work that defies categorization.\n\nCharles Demuth was born into a well-off patrician family. Although they never achieved  any conspicuous wealth, by a small-town standard it was enough that Demuth never had to work for a living in his life. He entered society with a sort of prodigal confidence, and although the absence of any social or economic ambitions gave him an enormous amount of freedom, it also contributed to his aimlessness and later frivolity. From an early age he considered himself an outsider, and around the age of five he succumbed to a hip illness which left him lame, but with which he physically coped quite well later on in his adult years. The prescribed cure for his mysterious disease (which was later identified as Perthes) was six weeks, followed by several years, in bed; this lead to his almost total dependency of his mother, Augusta, and left him with the life-long image as an invalid.\n\nDemuth was an introvert, absorbed in his own private world, and although he didn’t inherit his father’s strong physical genes, he coincided with him at least in one area - art. Among Charles’ great aunts and great uncles on his father’s side there were a lot of amateur painters. His father had also dabbled in amateur photography, though his passion for it had sprung from an antiquarian and historical pursuit instead of an aesthetic one. It was clear that the young Charles displayed an unusually precocious gift for art. While he was bedridden with disease, his mother had sent him to a local painter, Martha Bowman, to encourage the aptitude he had shown with crayons and watercolors. His decorative instincts, and his proclivity for subjective renderings, gave the works of the teenage boy an uncommon delicacy for such an early adolescent artistic endeavors.\n\nAt sixteen, Demuth enrolled in the Franklin and Marshall Academy, a boys’ preparatory school in Lancaster. After graduation, he did not immediately pursue art school, but instead remained at his home in Lancaster for more than two school years. No one in his family besides Aaron Eshlman (who wasn’t the best role model, having abandoned his wife and children) had pursued painting as a professional occupation.  However, in 1903, Demuth entered the Drexel Institute of Art, Science, and Industry in Philadelphia as an elementary art student, and in 1905 he entered the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, where he had [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-merritt-chase]William Merritt Chase[/url] and Thomas Anschutz as teachers.\n\nIn 1907, Demuth went to Paris, and his interactions with the local artistic styles, expressive forms and colors defined his later work. He was one of the few American painters of that period who had a complete understanding of the new European movements, such as [url href=Cubism]Cubism[/url] or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/dada#!#resultType:masonry]Dada[/url]. Demuth evolved in his art, always remaining receptive throughout his career to a wide range of styles and influences, which were intelligently transmuted in his works. Between 1912 and 1913, Demuth’s early watercolors reveal a fragile, understated style, with landscapes executed in delicate washes, evoking his European associations and inspirations. By 1915, he was already established as a major American artist through his flower studies, landscapes, and depictions of circus or cabaret performers. \n\nDemuth used the cubist technique with delicacy, developing the new precisionist style in his paintings of various industrial sites and factories, like in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-demuth/white-architecture-1917][i]White Architecture[/i][/url] (1917). Another painting from that period, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-demuth/two-acrobats-1918][i]Two Acrobats[/i][/url] (1918), depicts entertainers that surrealistically float through a vague landscape, reflecting Demuth’s strong taste for the psychologically distorted, decadence and deep sexual conflict. \n\nIn the late 1910s and early 1920s Demuth repeatedly traveled to Paris. As a gay man, he found the city more accepting than much of the United States, and a number of his paintings - which were not intended for public view at the time he painted them - vividly depict the vibrant gay subculture of postwar Paris. The Lafayette Baths became one of his favorite haunts, and is likely the setting of a[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-demuth/turkish-bath-with-self-portrait-1918] [i]Turkish Bath with Self Portrait[/i][/url] (1918). In 1921, illness forced Demuth to be admitted to hospital. He was treated and released, but was too unwell to return to America for two more months. Finally back home in Lancaster he was diagnosed with diabetes and began experimental treatments, including a near-starvation diet and insulin injections.\n\nIn 1923, Demuth began painting his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-demuth/all-works#!#filterName:Series_poster-portraits,resultType:masonry]series of \"poster portraits\"[/url], symbolic interpretations of the works of fellow artists and writers, including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georgia-o-keeffe]Georgia O'Keeffe[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arthur-dove]Arthur Dove[/url], John Marin, Gertrude Stein, and William Carlos Williams. That same year, Demuth became one of the first of his contemporaries to have work purchased for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's permanent collection. During the mid-1920s, he had several successful solo exhibitions and in 1927, the first book on his work was published, and he began his latest major [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-demuth/all-works#!#filterName:Series_architecture-of-lancaster,resultType:masonry]series of seven paintings, based on the architecture of Lancaster[/url]. The paintings became iconic representations of the industrialization of small-town America and cemented Demuth's reputation as the leading painter of the Precisionist movement, the first home-grown modern art movement within the United States.\n\nDemuth died in 1935 in Lancaster at age 51 due to complications from diabetes. In his will, he stipulated that many of his paintings should go to Georgia O'Keefe, whose role in determining which museums received his works helped preserve and fortify his reputation. Demuth was one of the first painters to give modernist form a distinctly American point of view, thus the significance of his work to the development of art in this country throughout the 20th century cannot be overstated. The influence of his industrial landscapes can immediately be seen in the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-sheeler]Charles Sheeler[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stuart-davis]Stuart Davis[/url], Gerald Murphy, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ralston-crawford]Ralston Crawford[/url]. By helping to develop an American offshoot of modernism, Demuth became a forerunner to later movements such as[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]

painter and etcher. His early career is not well documented; he spent about a decade in Italy (mainly Rome and Naples) as a young man, but it is only after he settled in Augsburg in 1652 that his development can be traced through dated works.

His style was lively and eclectic, drawing on various Italian influences, in his delicate colouring and lightness of touch he anticipates elements of German Rococo art.

a self-taught artist, Barry in 1763 attracted the patronage of his Irish compatriot Edmund Burke, who funded Barry’s stay in Italy from about 1766 to 1771 to study the Old Masters. Barry then returned to England and rose rapidly in his profession, becoming a member of the Royal Academy in 1773 and obtaining the commission to decorate the Royal Society rooms in 1777. The latter project occupied him until 1783. Barry was professor of painting at the Royal Academy from 1782 to 1799, but he died in poverty.\r\n\r\nBarry was an exponent of the “grand style” of Sir Joshua Reynolds; hence, he drew the subject matter for his ambitious figurative compositions from classical antiquity and from literary works. Stylistically, however, his linearity and undulating forms brought him closer to the work of the leaders of the English Neoclassical style, the sculptor John Flaxman and the poet-painter William Blake.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"James

There was a clear evolution in Cossiers’ career, which was not unlike that of some of his Antwerp contemporaries such as Simon de Vos and Theodoor Rombouts.\n\nCossiers started out as a painter of Caravaggesque genre scenes. He later became involved in the execution of religious and mythological compositions that were part of the large commissions of the Rubens workshop in the 1630s.

After graduating from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (PAFA) under the direction of Thomas Eakins, Smith would embark on a long and fruitful career. Her reputation would precede her, and today Smith is regarded as one of the most significant children's book illustrators of all time. \n\nAfter sitting in on her cousin's art lesson in 1883, Smith had changed her career path from teaching to art. In 1884, Smith enrolled in the Philadelphia Design School for Women, now Moore College of Art & Design. In 1885, Smith enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art (PAFA) where she studied under Thomas Eakins, Cecilia Beaux and Thomas Anshutz. In 1888, Smith's first publication [i]Three Little Maidens All in a Row[/i] was published. In June, Smith graduated from PAFA and soon moved to work for the advertising department of [i]Ladies Home Journal[/i]. \n\nIn 1894, Smith enrolled in the Drexel Institute, now Drexel University, to take classes under the Father of American Illustration, Howard Pyle. Her class consisted of her future lifelong friends and colleges Violet Oakley and Elizabeth Shippen Green. Almost half of Pyle's students were women, an unprecedented phenomenon at the time. From thereon, Smith's work would be highly influenced by Pyle's teachings. Pyle was a strong advocate for women in the field of illustration and encouraged his female students to pursue careers at large publishing houses. In 1897, Smith and Oakley collaborated on the illustrations for a new edition of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's [i]Evangeline[/i]. That same year, Smith finished her studies with Pyle to embark on her career. \n\nSmith, Green, and Oakley moved into the Red Rose Inn together in 1901. During their stay here, the trio of women would be so aptly called the \"Red Rose Girls.\" In Although she consistently collaborated with Oakley and Green, Smith would soon become inundated with work from the likes of [i]Century, Collier’s Weekly, Harper’s Bazaar, Leslie’s, McClure’s, Scribner’s, Women’s Home Companion, [/i]and [i]Good Housekeeping.[/i] At the same time, Smith had completed the illustrations for a bounty of children's books including [i]Rhymes of Real Children [/i](1903), [i]A Child's Garden of Verses[/i] (1905), [i]The Bed-Time Book[/i] (1907), [i] The Seven Ages of Childhood [/i](1909), [i]The Now-a-Days Fairy Book [/i](1911), [i]Twas The Night Before Christmas [/i] (1912), and several dozen others. Smith's picture book illustrations would become some of the most beloved and best known of her time.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Jessie Willcox Smith","relatedArtists":["57726df9edc2cb3880b54edf","57726de3edc2cb3880b52d5c","5b581be6edc2c918c834f79f","57726d8bedc2cb3880b49b78","57726d95edc2cb3880b4aedb","57726df2edc2cb3880b545a6","57726dc9edc2cb3880b5055c","57726dd8edc2cb3880b51ca4","57726e01edc2cb3880b55c42","57726e09edc2cb3880b58325","5790b15dedc2c9142434e2f1","57726d8aedc2cb3880b4995d","57726d7eedc2cb3880b47e13","5b180d7eedc2c90c88332f06","5a2d4f62edc2c9daa07dd737","57726deaedc2cb3880b53733","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4be5e","57726dfeedc2cb3880b555ca","57726d96edc2cb3880b4af6d","57726d88edc2cb3880b494cd"]},{"id":"5cd7a97cedc2c96cc4acbb3c","artistName":"Robert Hirst","url":"robert-hirst","lastNameFirst":"Hirst Robert","birthDay":"/Date(-23328000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 6, 1969","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00236/images/robert-hirst/img-072816509-1557638988556.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d81","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f61","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e78","57726a68edc2ca38801d4ff9","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7208"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":2015,"activeYearsCompletion":2019,"biography":"His work explores the relationship between chance, randomness, probability and the natural human impulse to seek visual structure. \n\nWith diverse influences from Andy Warhol, Robert Indiana and Roy Lichenstein of the American Pop Art movement to Contemporary Artists like Thomas Downing, Yayoi Kusama, Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst, his goal is to explore these connections through digital art, marrying aesthetic principles with colour theory and data visualizations, generated using by his own developed statistical and graphical computing software, and pseudo-random number generation.\n\nHaving worked as a professional engineer, tend to focus on the most significant aspects of the job at computers and try to assess what are the essential features of a visual experience, consequently tend to favour abstraction and minimalism .

first independent attempt at a painting was in 2013 for CTC. It took place just weeks after his baptism and confession to the Christian faith. At first, paint was an expressive experiment and the objective was to cover a canvas with that which laid heavy on his conscious. Some years passed and he entered collegiate studies causing transformative steps his artistic views were ready for and reverted him to biblically themed paintings. The occurrences in his life are entangled in his art and a goal now has become getting original quality paintings in the hands of enthusiasts at residential prices. Over 300 original oil and acrylic paintings are a part of his collection.\n\n[i]\"You must see to see my artwork.\"[/i] - CTC","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Christian T.

Parma school. His art foreshadowed the Rococo art of the 18th century with dynamic compositions and an illusory perspective. Little is known about Correggio’s early life or training. What is known is that he was apprenticed to Francesco Bianchi Ferrara between 1503 and 1505, after which he traveled through Italy painting religious works, becoming increasingly renowned. In 1514, he returned to his hometown of Correggio, and signed an agreement to complete the Madonna altarpiece in the St. Francis Monastery. \r\n\r\nCorreggio received his first major commission in 1519, when he agreed to paint the ceiling of the private dining salon of the mother superior of the St. Paul Convent in Parma, Italy. Further frescoes and paintings in the early 1520’s exhibit dynamic compositions, which evince movement that was theretofore unprecedented. This dynamism and Correggio’s use of an illusionary perspective characterized the new Baroque style. \r\n\r\nAlthough his works are now considered to have had a revolutionary impact on contemporary artists, they are all very eclectic, and no direct stylistic link connects all of them in one category. Little is known of his teachings, and so it is also difficult to determine the stylistic qualities that brought forth his talents. His character as a man was remembered as introverted, melancholic, and dark. He did not have any direct disciples, but his works were highly influential on painters outside of Parma, where he lived and worked. Parmigiano, Giorgio Gandini del Grano, and Giovanni Maria Francesco Rondani all show influences of his works.

has always been my best approach towards self-expression in my paintings, prints, and mixed media.  \nThis piece does exemplify my haunting experience of a visit to Venice, Italy. Walking along the winding canals and viewing an eclectic mixture of architecture, preserved throughout a millennium, becomes my framework for layering color, line, textures, and shapes that enhances the abstraction process and serves to express my emotions while constructing an idea.\nMy familiarity with representational art, perspective, also informs the space of my collaged abstractions which are structured along an imaginary architecture. The various geometries and diverse shapes, inspired by the local scenery, are assimilated within the collage to suggest occupied spaces without being illustrative of any place or time. Overlapping shapes and scaffolding planes rebound within my fantasy picture plane and are held in place by color areas utilized to create a visual harmony. Depending on my mood at the time, I’ll use bright colors that pop out at the viewer or muted tones to subdue a color’s intensity.\nHopefully, my artwork speaks for itself but, at the very least, I hope my artistic statement sheds some light on the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ of the creative activity which is channeled in each work.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Rafael

As a boy he lived in Amsterdam and later in Middelburg in the province Zeeland. He followed the Art Academy in Breda only for a few years. \nHe turned back to Amsterdam where he would live and work till now. \n\nLemaire followed painting lessons in Amsterdam from the surrealist painter Gerrit van het Net. That was a big part of the reason why he painted till circa 1980 in a figurative surrealist style. \nFor his living he accepted a job in the glass studio Tetterode in Amsterdam. Later he started to use these experiences and would create glass-sculptures by himself, first in the  technique of glass-applique.\nAfter 2004 Lemaire started to work in the glass-fusion technique which enabled him to create glass sculptures more painterly, because of the fusion of the used colors.\n\nHis painting style changed dramatically circa 1980. The art of Mark Rothko became then temporalely very important as an inspiration. \nHe mainly painted abstract in oil-paintings on canvas. \n\nFrom 2005 the watercolor technique on paper is his favorite medium.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Daan Lemaire","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726dfeedc2cb3880b55704","artistName":"Fons Heijnsbroek","url":"fons-heijnsbroek","lastNameFirst":"Heijnsbroek Fons","birthDay":"/Date(-568944000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"December 22, 1951","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/fons-heijnsbroek.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["5804eadaedc2ce45b4e01a76","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e69","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7458"],"periods":[{"id":"57726dfeedc2cb3880b5571b","title":"1984 - 1987: representational painting and drawing"},{"id":"57726dfeedc2cb3880b5571d","title":"1987 - 1989: figurative, symbolic painting"},{"id":"57726dfeedc2cb3880b5571f","title":"1989 - 1992: abstract landscape painting"},{"id":"57726dfeedc2cb3880b55721","title":"1993 - 1998: abstract expressionism painting with gesture"},{"id":"57726dfeedc2cb3880b55723","title":"1999 - 2002: free geometric abstract painting"},{"id":"57726dfeedc2cb3880b55725","title":"2003 - 2013: free abstract colorful painting on canvas and in watercolors"}],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1987,"activeYearsCompletion":2016,"biography":"[b]Fons Heijnsbroek, abstract painter[/b]\nFons Heijnsbroek is a Dutch painter-artist, living and working in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nHe mainly painted Abstract Expressionism in watercolor paintings on paper and acrylic paint on canvas.\n\nFons Heijnsbroek was born 22 December 1951 in the small old town Schiedam, nearby Rotterdam.\nIn 1958 his family moved to the Hague and later to Krommenie, in the area to the North of of Amsterdam.\nIt was in 1973 that Fons Heijnsbroek moved as a student to Amsterdam, to live there and to follow Social Pedagogy from 1973 till 1983.\nHe loved visiting the Dutch museums with their collections of the famous landscape-painters from The Netherlands, Germany, France and England - 17th century painters, The English Romantic landscape painters,Barbizon, French Impressionism and German Expressionism manily.  \n \nIn 1985 Heijnsbroek started his art-study at the Academy of Art in Utrecht to become a sculptor-artist. He did visit the Art Academy for for only two years without finishing this study and departed with the idea to become a painter instead of a sculptor.\nIn 1987 he started to become an independent artist and had his first exhibitions in Amsterdam.\nHe started with figurative paintings  and drawings, still inspired by German Expressionist painters. Religious subjects and questions played partly a strong role till 1989.\n \nHeijnsbroek learned himself a lot about modern painting art by visiting frequently the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam where he found a.o. painting by Willem de kooning and Bram van Velde. He also found in those years some important colleague-artists in Amsterdam which became very important for his artistic development: the abstract painter Daan Lemaire and the figurative expressionist painter Paul Werner. In particular Daan Lemaire became important in developing and encouraging the abstract approach in his painting art, which Fons Heijnsbroek started from 1989.\n\nIt were in particular the artists of American - and European - Abstract Expressionism and their characteristic emotional and individualistic attitude which attracted Heijnsbroek in his own early abstract years.\nBut still many of his abstract and dynamic painted canvasses in 1989 - 1991 found there source in his sketches of the typical Dutch landscape and its skies.  \nHeijnsbroek loved to wander through the dunes and along the North-sea, close to Harlem and Zandvoort. The landscape offered him structures for his compositions.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Fons Heijnsbroek","relatedArtists":["59983742edc2c9d2c4548d96","57726dbcedc2cb3880b4f016","57726de8edc2cb3880b53612","580f217dedc2c9826864b08d","57726de3edc2cb3880b52e70","57726da5edc2cb3880b4ca00","58389066edc2c9762c999127","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c93d","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c5c1","5b229c61edc2c91f5c1009af","57726da6edc2cb3880b4cc0e","57726dacedc2cb3880b4d676","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f3e8","57726da3edc2cb3880b4c7b3","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c925","57726dcdedc2cb3880b50a29","5a539ad4edc2c9e57867ba82","57726db1edc2cb3880b4de08","57726dd7edc2cb3880b51a8e","5838a380edc2c9762cbcfe1a"]},{"id":"5de61fa0edc2ccab480c9ae3","artistName":"Jules-Alexandre Grun","url":"jules-alexandre-grun","lastNameFirst":"Grün Jules-Alexandre","birthDay":"/Date(-3206304000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-1005955200000)/","birthDayAsString":"May 25, 1868","deathDayAsString":"February 15, 1938","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00265/images/jules-alexandre-grun/150807776-julesalexandre-gr-252n-1.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules-Alexandre_Gr%C3%BCn","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d31"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Jules-Alexandre Grün","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"5de7a0baedc2c94e60561022","artistName":"Senol Hocaoglu","url":"senol-hocaoglu","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(139622400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"June 5, 1974","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads3.wikiart.org/00265/images//k-k-kral-n-zaferi.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d31","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f28","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7368"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"oil on canvas.\nsize;60cm x 35cm\n2019","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Senol Hocaoglu","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"5de6a5c6edc2d0ab4887629f","artistName":"Berthold  Woltze","url":"berthold-woltze","lastNameFirst":"Woltze Berthold","birthDay":"/Date(-4429209600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-2306448000000)/","birthDayAsString":"August 24, 1829","deathDayAsString":"November 29, 1896","image":"https://uploads.wikiart.org/Content/images/ARTIST-480x600.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berthold_Woltze","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7248","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0","57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726d97edc2cb3880b4b16c","artistName":"Joachim Patinir","url":"joachim-patinir","lastNameFirst":"Patinir Joachim","birthDay":"/Date(-15462921600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-14050454400000)/","birthDayAsString":"c.1480","deathDayAsString":"October 5, 1524","image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/joachim-patinir.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Patinir","dictionaries":["57726b4aedc2cb3880ad67b8","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7240","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad66a8","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88","57726a66edc2ca38801d4cb1"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1515,"activeYearsCompletion":1524,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Joachim Patinir (de Patiner)","relatedArtists":["57726d81edc2cb3880b48431","587c9770edc2c9546c128955","5978dfe5edc2c98ad0bb50f1","57726d89edc2cb3880b497c1","57726ddbedc2cb3880b52093","57726d8cedc2cb3880b49e1c","57726d8bedc2cb3880b49a35","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ab7b","57726d80edc2cb3880b482bd","57726d81edc2cb3880b48431","57726d8aedc2cb3880b49857","57726db8edc2cb3880b4e974","5af187deedc2c9b320011db1","5978dfe5edc2c98ad0bb50f1","57726d95edc2cb3880b4ae9b","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ab63","57726d7fedc2cb3880b481c6","57726d87edc2cb3880b49271","57726d7cedc2cb3880b47b32","57726d83edc2cb3880b48822"]},{"id":"58128831edc2c948d420ba85","artistName":"Thomas Dewing","url":"thomas-dewing","lastNameFirst":"Dewing Thomas","birthDay":"/Date(-3744662400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-983232000000)/","birthDayAsString":"May 4, 1851","deathDayAsString":"November 5, 1938","image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/00157/images/thomas-dewing/thomas-wilmer-dewing-1.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dewing","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d29","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad6768","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d21"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"\"Muted in shimmering softness, Dewing’s slender, refined figures are contemporary but timeless, aesthetic objects at one with the paintings’ harmonious compositions and tonal color schemes.

A quote that has an influence on all my paintings! The quick and easy availability of information at the click of a button has not only changed the way we live but also our relationships. The Dairy of my life is filled with experiences of such evolving relationships between men and women, which I portray through my works.\nSince childhood, I have always been passionate about figurative works. With passage of time and experience, my style has evolved into powerful imagery. I use perfect symmetrical forms like squares, rectangles, checks and butterflies to cover my human figures thereby symbolizing the strive for constant improvement and perfection of the contemporary human race. \nMy paintings portray the relationships of the 21st century men and women, their emotions and chemistry. They manifest and exemplify the kind of complete freedom exercised by both genders, in the present times.\nEach of my works involve a lot of iterations and white board sketching till I finally arrive at the desired composition that conveys the story I want to narrate. \nFor the last decade, I have worked out of my studio, portraying the subjects of my paintings from everyday experiences of my own, acquaintances and even strangers and depicting them in a contemporary manner. My style is very fresh and has been profoundly appreciated and accepted not only in India but also internationally.\nOver the years, my Shows in India and Overseas have received tremendous appreciation and have been very successful. I have steadily established myself within the Indian and International Art Market. My works have featured in various newspaper articles and many of them have been sold to renowned private collectors and interior designers in India and Internationally.\nI see myself as a bold artist of the present and future era. I am inspired by artists like Michelangelo, Van Gogh, Dale, Picasso, Amrita Shergil, Anjoli Ela Menon and so many others.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Sonaly

Alaa Awad is most famous for his murals as a painter. He received an M.A in Fine Arts from Helwan University, and his B.A. from South Valley University, Faculty of Fine Arts, in Luxor, where he also  received his PhD in 2019 and continues to teach. His dissertation was entitled “Artistic Vision Inspired by the Murals of War and Peace in Ancient Egyptian Art.” He has participated in international exhibitions and events in France, Germany, Denmark, China, and the United States, and his artwork is held within numerous private collections. Based in Luxor, he is deeply inspired by his ancient Egyptian heritage and his artwork explores that influence along with contemporary society, Sufism, and rural Egyptian culture. His murals in Cairo during the Egyptian Revolution in 2011 epitomized the emotions and struggles of the people and earned his fame.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Alaa Awad","relatedArtists":["57726dffedc2cb3880b55911","592749e2edc2c920a410fc4c","5978f890edc2c98ad00df855","5a100709edc2c9c6b4339943","57726dd7edc2cb3880b51a4f","58b2a37aedc2c97404feab53","5b35e592edc2c92434f9d709","59d4e7b5edc2c919109f1649","58dc1defedc2c9215006f4bd","57726e04edc2cb3880b560d8","59884ee5edc2c98edc6a3bd2","594b4586edc2c912247f5a91","57726defedc2cb3880b540f0","59a4c397edc2c96a1070bb07","58e5865eedc2c98c788f5455","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c4a0","59482570edc2c9a048b9c2fc","5b3d37c8edc2c92414cbacf5","5b8281c0edc2c918ccd34a56","57726e06edc2cb3880b5640f"]},{"id":"59bee5dbedc2c9bb642cd2cb","artistName":"Francis Naranjo","url":"francis-naranjo","lastNameFirst":"Naranjo Francis","birthDay":"/Date(-283996800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1961","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00150/images//francis-naranjo-2009.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726a68edc2ca38801d4f61","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e78","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7208"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"https://francisnaranjofund.wixsite.com/francisnaranjo","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["57726dacedc2cb3880b4d68c","59f23c2cedc2c98860711a6c","57726de7edc2cb3880b5342d","5841c46eedc2c99dd0aed151","5a7b00f3edc2c9367c888e18","59f6e6ccedc2c9f1cc6b7a3f","57726de2edc2cb3880b52d30","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f83c","57726daaedc2cb3880b4d304","57726dc0edc2cb3880b4f60f","57726dd9edc2cb3880b51d58","57726d87edc2cb3880b492c2","5b7c2626edc2c916048f8e33","57726e03edc2cb3880b55f38","57726dfbedc2cb3880b5523b","57726df0edc2cb3880b541dc","57726deaedc2cb3880b5374b","57726dd4edc2cb3880b514ee","5a569ccfedc2c9952c1b6768","57726dd3edc2cb3880b513f0"]},{"id":"57726dc9edc2cb3880b50544","artistName":"Vladimir Dimitrov","url":"vladimir-dimitrov","lastNameFirst":"Dimitrov Vladimir","birthDay":"/Date(-2774304000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-292550400000)/","birthDayAsString":"February 1, 1882","deathDayAsString":"September 24, 1960","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/a0de4844-1f3f-475e-8926-5beed320614e.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Dimitrov","dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad72d8","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d31"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Vladimir Dimitrov — Maystora","relatedArtists":["57726dbdedc2cb3880b4f10d","57726df7edc2cb3880b54bac","57726d96edc2cb3880b4afb5","57726d8bedc2cb3880b49b04","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d849","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d4c7","57726dd1edc2cb3880b51132","57726dc9edc2cb3880b504a2","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e494","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aaec","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a0e8","57726d86edc2cb3880b48fe1","57726dc9edc2cb3880b504b9","57726dcaedc2cb3880b5058f","5ac0d1c7edc2c9eb7471eb00","588d4339edc2c9b47c2edba4","57726dfcedc2cb3880b55306","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f374","57726d93edc2cb3880b4a9ea","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51ebf"]},{"id":"59353174edc2c97fa806d310","artistName":"Dora Boneva","url":"dora-boneva","lastNameFirst":"Boneva Dora","birthDay":"/Date(-1064275200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 11, 1936","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads3.wikiart.org/00135/images//img-9750ihm.JPG!Portrait.JPG","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_Boneva","dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad72d8","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d61","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Boneva was born in 1936 and she received her master's degree from the Academy of Fine Arts in Sofia.

He consolidated his training during a series of stays with contemporary masters of realism such as the Norwegian painter Odd Nerdrum, Guillermo Muñoz Vera or Antonio López.\n\nHis personal work involves an impressive display of pictorial resources with a refined and mannerism-free technique that responds to the canon of contemporary classical figuration, continuously investigating new concepts and plasticities.\n\nHis artistic vision has also developed thanks to his teaching role at the Barcelona Academy of Art, which he founded in 2013. It is at the Academy where he grows, expands and shares his knowledge of classical methods, along with the idea that these need to continue to be valued as a tool that helps the interpretation and artistic representation of today's world. Alamà points out that classical figuration is not the only way but the most direct one to immerse yourself in the world of sensitivity and creative expression.\n\nIn 2017, he faced one of the most important challenges of his career with the creation of the work The Cross of the Jubilee, a monumental commission for the Church of the Dolors in Vic (Spain). In his series #ClásicosDesollados, he merges his implacable technique with bursts of abstraction; cutting, tearing and literally skinning the most iconic works of the great masters from Velázquez to Rembrandt to highlight their inherent modernity.\n\nWith the series inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy, Alamà faces again a monument of universal history, anchored in collective memory, and reaffirms his commitment to contemporary realistic figuration.\n\nHis works can be found in the collections of the European Museum of Modern Art and the Can Framis Museum in Barcelona and in private collections in Europe, the United States and Australia.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Jordi Diaz Alamà","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726d8aedc2cb3880b4995d","artistName":"N.C.

Soon he started to practice figurative sculpture. In 1959 his study period came to an end. In the beginning of the1960s he abandoned figuration and was making non-figurative sculpture, using stone, plaster of Paris, plywood and later steel.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1982 Carlos Granger interrupted his sculptural work and turned to photography of sculpture, still lifes and landscape. He continued making steel sculpture  and worked exclusively in steel for a long time; sometimes he painted his sculpture. \n\nSince 1989 Granger lives and works in Amsterdam and was connected there with gallery Josine Bokhoven. It was in the mid-90s that he started to make volumetric mass sculpture in cast concrete, often combined with steel.

Throughout his long and prolific career, he has worked in a variety of mediums: painting, printing, photography and film. Edward Ruscha was born in 1937 in Omaha, Nebraska, and was later raised in Oklahoma City. At the age of eighteen, he moved to Los Angeles, where he studied at the Chouinard Art Institute (now the California Institute of Arts) from 1956 to 1960. Initially, Ruscha intended to focus on commercial art, and early on, he worked in advertising as a layout artist and a sign painter. Even though he ultimately gravitated toward fine art, his experience and knowledge of advertising proved significant and influenced his style and choice of subject. \n\nThere are several early influences that helped shape Ruscha’s artistic identity. One of these was conceptual French artist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/marcel-duchamp]Marcel Duchamp[/url], who Ruscha met when the Pasadena Art Museum held Duchamp’s first U.S retrospective. In particular, Ruscha was interested in Duchamp’s ‘readymade’ objects that were transformed through unexpected titles and a clever use of text. Another important influence was Pop Art: he saw [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein]Roy Lichtenstein[/url]’s paintings at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol]Andy Warhol[/url]’s Campbell’s soup can paintings at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. Beyond these artistic influences, Los Angeles also played a significant role in Ruscha’s art: paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/large-trademark-with-eight-spotlights-1962][i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i][/url] (1962) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/hollywood-1969][i]Hollywood[/i][/url] (1969) referenced the city’s landscape and its association with the entertainment and movie industry.\n\nRuscha rose to prominence during the 1960s with paintings, such as [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] (1962), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/actual-size-1962][i]Actual Size[/i][/url] (1962) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/standard-station-1966][i]Standard Station[/i][/url] (1966). These depictions of mundane scenes and objects related to broader issues of consumerism and mass culture. Additionally Ruscha gained attention for his word paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/honk-1962][i]Honk[/i][/url] (1962). Toward the end of the 1960s, he further developed this theme with ‘liquid word’ paintings, like [i]Adios[/i] (1967) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/city-1969][i]City[/i][/url] (1969). Throughout his career, Ruscha continuously explored the relationship between art and text, often painting seemingly random words and phrases. In the 1980s, he even developed a font called Boy Scout Utility Modern, which he described as ‘non-style’ typeface. In works like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/not-a-bad-world-is-it-1984][i]Not A Bad World, Is It?[/i][/url] (1984) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/daily-planet-2003][i]Daily Planet[/i][/url] (2003) he uses the font to covers natural landscapes with common phrases and words.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of Ruscha’s art is his fondness for experimentation. During the 1970s he worked with a variety of materials, for instance the work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/dance-1973-0][i]Dance?[/i][/url] (1973) was made with multiple edible ingredients like coffee, egg white and mustard. In the 1980s, he began painting with an airbrush, with which he produced a group of paintings featuring silhouettes of animals, ships and wagon trains. Even though the subjects were humorous and cartoonish, the works had an ominous and dark atmosphere that was new to Ruscha’s body of work. Paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/rabbit-1986][i]Rabbit[/i][/url] (1986) have a murky, nocturnal glow that can be both comforting and threatening. Considered one of the most iconic artist of the 20th century, Ruscha is still active, living and working in Southern California.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Edward Joseph Ruscha

He received some notoriety during the early decades of the French Third Republic for his paintings of nude women. Ballavoine received his formal art education at the École des Beaux Art in Paris under historical painter Isidore Alexandre Augustin Pils. He exhibited his first oil painting at the Paris Salon in 1865, where he exhibited regularly for the next thirty years. Ballavoine had great success with his paintings of small Paris street scenes, which were said to rival those of Jean Beraud. But it was his exquisitely executed pictures of young women, such as Penning a Love Letter, that are the most desirable. Ballavoine last exhibited in 1911. Most of his works are now held in private collections.\n\n[url href=https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/jules_frederic_ballavoine_artwork.html]Jules Fredric Ballavoine Artwork For Sale[/url]","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"5e53bcfcedc2c9ece81f52fb","artistName":"FRANK A.

Born at Union Springs in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, just south of Auburn, Barney first studied at the Arts Students League in New York City, followed by brief instruction at William Merritt Post's studio in West Morris (now Bantum), Connecticut. As with many artists; his style evolved—his early paintings are reminiscent of the Hudson River school; however, in the late 1890’s, after a trip to France, financed by Auburn industrialist and prison reformer, Thomas Mott Osborne, he appears to have adopted a style more in line with that of the French Impressionists. His palette lightened considerably and his compositions are less structured than typical of the Hudson River artists. Barney never became associated with a gallery in order to promote his work, preferring instead to sell his paintings on his own. Although, he is little known outside of the Finger Lakes region—he had moved permanently to Auburn in 1907, he continued to travel New York City and to Connecticut to paint. During the Great Depression (1930’s) the Federal Government sought to put American back to works, including its artists. Barney is included in the list of artists that participated in the Federal Art Project (FAP) of the Works Progress Administration. While he lived in New York, Barney became a member of Salmagundi Club. He exhibited frequently at the National Academy of Design (1881-1897) and Syracuse Museum of Fine Art (1911-1919). He also exhibited at the Rochester Art Club (1892), the New York State Fair (1897), the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1903), the Society of Independent Artists (1922), the Binghamton Museum of Fine Art (1936), and the Finger Lakes Regional Show (1939 and 1946).\nIn addition to offering the artwork below for sale, Bedford Fine Art Gallery is also actively seeking to purchase artwork by Frank A.

child, he did not become an artist until he was in his fifties. He was born in Brooklyn, New York and as a teenager, moved to Iowa where he worked on his brother’s farm. A few years later, he studied law and was admitted to the Iowa bar in 1860. During his law career, his name became linked to that of John Brown of the infamous Harper’s Ferry raid, whose life he unsuccessfully sought to save. Following the Civil War, he left his law practice to open a pharmacy in Fort Dodge, Iowa. Finally, he yielded to the siren’s call of art, sold his pharmacy and began his painting career in earnest.\n\nView [url href=https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/david_john_gue.html]David John Gue

Semeonovitch Liberman was a Russian-American magazine editor, publisher, painter, photographer, and sculptor. He held senior artistic positions during his 32 years at Condé Nast Publications.\r\n\r\nWhen his father took a post advising the Soviet government, the family moved to Moscow. Life there became difficult, and his father secured permission from Lenin and the Politburo to take the boy to London in 1921.\r\n\r\nYoung Liberman was educated in Russia, England and France, and took up life as a white émigré in Paris. He began his publishing career in Paris with the early pictorial magazine Vu, where he worked under Lucien Vogel and with photographers such as Brassaï, André Kertész, and Robert Capa. After emigrating to New York in 1941, he began working for Condé Nast Publications, rising to the position of Editorial Director, which he held from 1962-1994.\r\n\r\nOnly in the 1950s did Liberman take up painting and, later, metal sculpture. His highly recognizable sculptures are assembled from industrial objects (segments of steel I-beams, pipes, drums, etc.,) often painted in uniform bright colors. In a 1986 interview concerning his formative years as a sculptor and his aesthetic, Liberman said, \"I think many works of art are screams, and I identify with screams.\"  Prominent examples of his work are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Storm King Art Center, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park, Tate Gallery, and the Guggenheim Museum. His massive work \"The Way\", a 65 feet (20 m) x 102 feet (31 m) x 100 feet (30 m) structure made of eighteen salvaged steel oil tanks, became a signature piece of Laumeier Sculpture Park and a major landmark of St. Louis, Missouri.\r\n\r\nHe was briefly married (August 25, 1936) Hildegarde Sturm, a model and competitive skier. His second wife (since 1942), Tatiana Yacovleff du Plessix Liberman (1906–1991), had been a childhood playmate and baby sitter. In 1941, they escaped together from occupied France, via Lisbon, to New York. She had operated a hat salon in Paris, then designed hats for Henri Bendel in New York. She continued in millinery at Saks Fifth Avenue until the mid-1950s, where she was billed as \"Tatania du Plessix\" or \"Tatania of Saks\". In 1992 he married Melinda Pechangco, a nurse who had cared for Tatiana during an earlier illness. His stepdaughter, Francine du Plessix Gray, is a noted author.

Significant exhibitions held in London and New York marked Surrealism as a truly global movement. However, by late 1940 with Paris occupied by the Nazis and a puppet government in place at Vichy, Breton and his fellow surrealist (René Char, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/oscar-dominguez]Oscar Dominguez[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/victor-brauner]Victor Brauner[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-ernst]Max Ernst[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-h-rold]Jacques Hérold[/url], Wilfredo Lam, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-masson]André Masson[/url], Benjamin Péret) were holed up in a mansion in Marseilles waiting to go into exile to America. Max Ernst was there after having been first interned as a German national by the French and then by the Gestapo as a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/degenerate-art]degenerate artist[/url]. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonora-carrington]Leonora Carrington[/url] was down below in a psychiatric institute in Madrid. Pierre Unik would end up in a concentration camp, from which he managed to escape, only to then vanish into thin air.\n\nBeing stuck, the Surrealists concentrated their energies on re-designing the standard deck of playing cards. Away with royalty, the court cards were banished and replaced by figures of Genius, Siren, and Magus. Each new figure comes from the surrealist pantheon. Sade is the Genius of Wheels, Alice (of Wonderland fame) is Siren of Stars, and Novalis is Magus of Flames, etc. The suits are neither traditional playing card suits or the tarot suits but are re-fashioned in a surrealist manner. However, the usual two black/two red color scheme is retained (there was no reason to change colors with such strong revolutionary links). The suits are Locks (Black) to represent knowledge, Stars (Black) dreams, Wheels (Red) revolution, and Flames (Red) love.\n\nDespite the commitment to revolution, there is a notable lack of political figures represented. Hegel is the Genius of Locks, but his most famous disciple Marx is left out. Sade is represented as the Genius of Wheels, but then Sade for the Surrealists was always the apostle of total freedom. Pancho Villa, as the Magus of  Wheels, is the only figure whose fame rests sorely on revolutionary politics.\n\nIn contrast, two occultist features, Helene Smith, the muse of automatic writing and medium as the Siren of Locks (incidentally, the only Siren that isn’t fictional) and Paracelsus the Renaissance doctor and occultist as the Genius of Locks. This would suggest that Surrealism was moving away from direct political action towards the occultation that Breton had posited in the [i]Second Manifesto[/i] as the real goal of the movement. Given the Surrealist’s split with the French Communist Party, the show trials in Moscow, the Spanish Civil War, Trotsky’s assassination in Mexico City, and the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact, a level of disillusionment is understandable. Breton sincerely wanted Surrealism to be more than just another art movement to achieve a radical transformation of life, which he believed best effected through collective membership in a Party dedicated to revolutionary action. However, Surrealism was never to square the circle of blindly obeying Party diktats and retaining artistic autonomy.\n\nThe fact of being in Marseilles may have suggested and lent an occult slant to the whole enterprise, as the very name given to the deck, [i]Le Jeu De Marseille[/i], acknowledges their awareness of the [i]Tarot De Marseille[/i], one of the oldest and most copied of all Tarot decks. Although [i]Le Jeu Du Marseille[/i] is limited to the standard 52 cards plus two jokers (Jarry’s Ubu Roi) and the major arcana is excluded, the Marseille reference indeed suggests that one of its many purposes is divinatory.\n\nIt may initially strike us as odd that with France occupied, Europe at war and their future so uncertain that the Surrealists should employ their time in playing around with card design. But it is entirely in keeping with Surrealism’s founding tenets, as well as pointing towards its future direction. The seriousness of games, the primacy of play over work, imagination re-claiming its rights. In the years of exile to follow and the post-war period, the increasing importance of the esoteric: alchemy, Tarot, and hermeticism. Surrealism as a secret society, a fraternity invisible to all except the initiated.","gender":"","originalArtistName":"Le Jeu De Marseille","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726ddcedc2cb3880b52303","artistName":"Pierre Roy","url":"pierre-roy","lastNameFirst":"Roy Pierre","birthDay":"/Date(-2820960000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-607996800000)/","birthDayAsString":"August 10, 1880","deathDayAsString":"September 26, 1950","image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/pierre-roy.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Roy_%28painter%29","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e21","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f20","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Pierre Roy","relatedArtists":["57726d81edc2cb3880b483ee","57726d88edc2cb3880b49497","57726db4edc2cb3880b4e33c","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c439","57726d89edc2cb3880b4971d","57726dafedc2cb3880b4d9dc","57726d87edc2cb3880b49292","57726ddbedc2cb3880b5207b","57726d7fedc2cb3880b48109","57726dd6edc2cb3880b5183a","57726da8edc2cb3880b4cf95","57726d83edc2cb3880b48878","57726de4edc2cb3880b52ee2","57726da0edc2cb3880b4c30b","57726d87edc2cb3880b491ed","57726d85edc2cb3880b48e10","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bd59","57726dacedc2cb3880b4d5da","57726d9fedc2cb3880b4bfba","57726db4edc2cb3880b4e324"]},{"id":"57726d7cedc2cb3880b47b8c","artistName":"Yves Tanguy","url":"yves-tanguy","lastNameFirst":"Tanguy Yves ","birthDay":"/Date(-2208643200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-472176000000)/","birthDayAsString":"January 5, 1900","deathDayAsString":"January 15, 1955","image":"https://uploads.wikiart.org/Content/images/ARTIST-480x600.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Tanguy","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"  ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Raymond Georges Yves Tanguy","relatedArtists":["57726d7aedc2cb3880b478b9","57726d7fedc2cb3880b48109","57726d7fedc2cb3880b481c6","57726d84edc2cb3880b48b8d","57726d85edc2cb3880b48e10","57726d87edc2cb3880b491ed","57726d89edc2cb3880b4971d","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d532","57726dededc2cb3880b53d65","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e560","57726dc2edc2cb3880b4fa07","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f2e9","57726d83edc2cb3880b488b2","57726dd5edc2cb3880b517a9","57726d82edc2cb3880b48668","57726d87edc2cb3880b49265","57726dd6edc2cb3880b51945","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bdb3","57726da6edc2cb3880b4cbdb","57726dd2edc2cb3880b51278"]},{"id":"5a4100dbedc2c9a684d43bef","artistName":"Małgorzata Serwatka","url":"malgorzata-serwatka","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(-302659200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"May 30, 1960","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00164/images//38a1.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726a68edc2ca38801d4f59","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e48","57726a67edc2ca38801d4ef9","57726a67edc2ca38801d4ea9","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7260","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f28"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100001","title":"Frame"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100002","title":"Mothers"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100003","title":"Dauka"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100004","title":"Horses"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100005","title":"Birds"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100006","title":"Postproduction"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100007","title":"Race"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100008","title":"Poetic Rags"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100009","title":"Secrets"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100010","title":"Galactic Landscapes"},{"id":"5a40f6a4edc2c9a684100011","title":"Nests"},{"id":"5a4104d0edc2c9a684100000","title":"Intimate Portraits"},{"id":"5e74ca73edc2c9f118100000","title":"War"},{"id":"5e74d76eedc2c9f118100000","title":"Cats"},{"id":"5e74eb4eedc2c9f118100000","title":"Kobietony"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Polish painter, performer and cultural activist.

Heitmuller moved to the North Side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1893. He was to become prominent in Pittsburgh art circles and accompanied Pittsburgh landscape painter, George Hetzel, to Scalp Level (near Johnstown, PA) on occasion. Most of his portraiture work was done prior to immigrating to the United States, while landscapes were a larger part of his oeuvre while living in Pittsburgh. Heitmuller also depicted the steel mills that existed along Pittsburgh’s river at that time. This painting is one of three obtained from a descendent of Heitmuller’s landlord on Hobart Street in Squirrel Hill (PA). Heitmuller would give the landlord paintings in lieu of rent. During the last ten years of his life, Heitmuller painted Biblical scenes for Pittsburgh Churches. Heitmuller had just moved to St. Petersburg, Florida when he died. He was a member Society of Independent Artists, where he exhibited and also exhibited at the First Carnegie International (Pittsburgh, 1896).\nIn addition to offering the artwork below for sale, [url href=https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/]Bedford Fine Art Gallery[/url] is also actively seeking to purchase [url href=https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/louis_heitmuller_art.html]artwork by Louis Heitmuller[/url].","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Ludwig Heitmuller","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"5e76a060edc2c9afa471e14f","artistName":"REUBEN LEGRANDE JOHNSTON","url":"reuben-legrande-johnston","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(-3786825600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1850","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads.wikiart.org/Content/images/ARTIST-480x600.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":[],"periods":[{"id":"5e769e73edc2c9afa4100000","title":"19th century"}],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1850,"activeYearsCompletion":1915,"biography":"[url href=https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/reuben_legrande_johnston_artwork.html]Reuben LeGrande Johnston[/url] was born in Alexandria, Virginia and was a member of Washington Society and world traveler.

Dabbling in plastic art since 7, he has participated in various art competitions in his native Uruguay and abroad. At 14, Paz Viola began to participate in group shows and individual shows nationally and internationally in galleries and museums in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, United States, Italy, among others.\nThe most notable influences of Paz Viola are Roberto Matta, Maurits Cornelis Escher, Joan Miró, Vasili Kandinski, Max Ernst, as well as Uruguayan artist and friend Javier Gil, who imbued a sense of motion into rigid objects as if everything had a life of its own – a concept expressed in Paz Viola’s series “Nothing in the Void”.\n\nCritic's Notes\nOntological concepts, jubilant style and instinct make a magical mix in the works of Mauricio Paz Viola, creating visual images secure in their aesthetic expression, and marvelously incisive for the viewer ... terrific for those who are fond of introspection.\n\nThe works of Paz Viola alludes to the hidden charm of the abstraction to the point of almost subordinating all conceptual speculation to genuine emotional experiences, a proposal typical of any authentic art where aesthetics are at play with our senses. In his works - extensive, powerful color schemes in preliminary states, covering the canvas in an organic manner, with a rhythm as if animated by the compositional force that sprung from the bond between the artist and the Universe. I would say that even more significant is the visual materialization of the dialogue between the existential author that delves into the profound consciousness of origin.\n\nIf there were a way in which Paz Viola connects with art, it would be reflection, with his own techniques - which is why his visual language takes us directly to the core of his works and transforming them into purely symbolic elements. Nevertheless, the artist seems to be taking away from using a story or taking the reins of narrative, retaining on the canvas only what is perpetual, infinite and what speaks for itself ...\n\nI believe that the magnitude of images reflect the artist's creative and cognitive will, and an example of this would be the series \"Nothing in the Void\" where the author expands on the extreme idea of a kind of meaning where the human-universe duality dissolves in the immenseness Presented with a subtle touch of personal nostalgia, the series nevertheless features explosions of color and spaces, enticing the viewer in an intense, limitless realm while striking music in their heartstrings.\n\n (Ricardo César Lescano Grosso), Art critic in Argentina\n\nMauricio Paz Viola proposes a new approach to contemporary art through fantastical images of his own ideation, creating a wondrous landscape that invites imagination, physical and psychic, organic metaphors in virtual, ethereal and luminous worlds with a lyrical, person graphology like few are able to , In order to strive for perfection in beauty which springs from his inner cosmos.\n\n \n\nThe creative impulse is palpable all over the canvas, in its transparencies, its persistent yet innovative propositions of its own world, which opens to us through his writing, which is painting and drawing at the same time and masterfully and spontaneously conveys his cosmos, transforming The viewer into silent witnesses to a world where time loses its relevance and shapes indefinitely regenerate, becoming permanent movements in the eyes of observers.\n\n \n\nPaz Viola eludes to straight-forward interpretation: rather, I have defined his own landscape, articulating new horizons of joyful inspiration, with singular effects of light and shade, of dreamy colors in their textures and shapes. Henceforth, Paz Viola reveals his anxiety as an artist and a human being - anxious to reveal his self, while his work appears as a fragment of a unique composition, an element of his secret intention to reveal the inner world of his imagination which Nourishes his creations.\n\n \n\nThe colors used by Paz Viola are not colors of the nature. Rather, they are invented, perhaps to generate uncanny visions of his dreams and his poetic wanderings: lights and sparks shining out of blue and orange, luring views to dabble in the world of Paz Viola ... unexpected radiance that takes views to the realms of magic , To an imagined and fabulous world sustained by masterfully wrought colors, in a state of constant change and creation, shapes that interlace and reinvent themselves, mixing colors, giving birth to new volumes, ebullient of perfect transparency and light.\n\n \n\nPaz Viola presents a dynamic and incandescent landscape, which is deeply personal with an unequivocal singularity and originality, in which his works as a young artist and creator. While years will add to his mastery which is already evident, and will surely travel new paths towards new possibilities of wonder.\n\n \n\nIt is difficult to overlook his work: viewers are inevitably drawn to behold them, to enter them and be carried away by the artist's way of seeing and seeing - which alone can testify to its value the plastic expression. It is impossible not to explore the hidden nooks and corners and find them lights and shadows. Inertia has no place in his work, and monotony is nonexistent: with multiplied visual realms, of which each is a landscape, a vision, and all come together and form a parable - familiar, friendly, speaking to us in another tongue, in a Unique language of Paz Viola.\n\n \n\nThe vibrant lines elevate shapes and colors to glory, with magic transpiring from all his creations - an epic magic that lends itself to the movement of shapes and the vitality and transparency of color. Paz Viola blazes his own trail: he is his own influence, and therein lies the litmus proof of his weight as an artist. The spatiality in his paintings mark the beginning of the viewer's journey, while his impeccable techniques grips observers till the end of their artistic musings.\n\n \n\nPaz Viola has a remarkable sensitivity with colors, and his paintings lay bare the depth and sensuality of his highly original textures that have broken free from conventions ... Peace Viola gifts us with his existential mystique in every brush, weaving fantasies that dance between the familiar and The unknown, opening new dimensions through his canvas wormholes ... Peace Viola shows a fresh path in a creative cosmos that exists only in his spirit and subconsciousness. From such intimate space are born his creations, which grow, change and multiple towards perfection.\n\n \n\nPaz Viola is a good example of mediums at the service of ideas, of his unwavering horizons, of his colors - pink, orange, saturated or translucent, transfiguring in dark puzzles or luminous sparkles - like an x-ray of his imagination, of his Spirit\n\n \n\nEmerging gracefully out of his experimental audacity, Paz Viola seeks in the other than representing his genuine essence as a human being and an artist through his intimate and distinctive touch.\n\n \n\n (Martin Astorga), plastic artist and culture manager\n\n\n\nNothing in the Void consists of interpretations of subjective and illusory images inspired by the author's sensations and memories:\n\nThere is a planet called Ergon, far, away from our solar system and found in the first order of light of creation at the distance from us, in one of the many universes of the first order, created by the highest , the absolute unity, or God.\n\n On this planet thrives to hostile ecology, full of constant danger for their dwellers. In the nature full of extraordinarily shaped (almost shapeless) things are composed of pure matters and a divine, almost perfect energy, which live in endless battle with one another.\nErgonomicism arises out of the dialectic juxtoposition of \"ergon\" (energy) and realism (reality, of being real), and refers to that is energy and movement in reality, which is then captured and rendered through images, landscapes, flows, matters , beings, etc in an dream-like world created by the author.\n\nOne of the key features of these images is that they reflect light, energy, vitality as well as constant movements and vibrations. There are multiple forms of expression - lines, points, repetitions of large shapes that cross each other, mix together, move and move into one another, creating new shapes and images, as if each has a life of its own","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Mauricio Paz Viola","relatedArtists":["5a85023bedc2c9584c46dc78","59fa3025edc2c976586d4413","57fb80e8edc2c95dd085c44c","5b35e592edc2c92434f9d709","57726de8edc2cb3880b53578","58e5865eedc2c98c788f5455","57726db2edc2cb3880b4e025","5bedb243edc2c915a0be772c","5838a380edc2c9762cbcfe1a","5a8e0d62edc2c976347197f9","5ac8f4baedc2c9d01803d212","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c5a8","57726df3edc2cb3880b5461e","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bd2a","57726dc7edc2cb3880b50144","57726db9edc2cb3880b4ea11","57726dcdedc2cb3880b50a15","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dc48","57726da0edc2cb3880b4c150","57726ddbedc2cb3880b520bb"]},{"id":"57726dc3edc2cb3880b4fb32","artistName":"Leonora Carrington","url":"leonora-carrington","lastNameFirst":"Carrington Leonora","birthDay":"/Date(-1664323200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1306281600000)/","birthDayAsString":"April 6, 1917","deathDayAsString":"May 25, 2011","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/temp/2471ee37-714e-414f-8540-6a9f818f14a0.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonora_Carrington","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e8","5bed5be4edc2c90dc8d1d9b9","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7250","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Leonora Carrington OBE","relatedArtists":["57726d87edc2cb3880b491ed","57726dccedc2cb3880b509d3","57726deeedc2cb3880b53e6d","57726dededc2cb3880b53d92","57726ddcedc2cb3880b522a7","58f4f709edc2c90ffc6cb216","57726ddaedc2cb3880b51ff3","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e768","57726db7edc2cb3880b4e750","57726dd9edc2cb3880b51da6","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e1a1","57726de0edc2cb3880b5290b","5be1d849edc2c906e4ccdc33","5bd003adedc2c92138a0d081","57726dfaedc2cb3880b550bb","57726da6edc2cb3880b4cb91","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ecef","57726de1edc2cb3880b52ad3","57726dededc2cb3880b53cf1","59b0e214edc2c922c86292d3"]},{"id":"57726d99edc2cb3880b4b4b9","artistName":"Remedios Varo","url":"remedios-varo","lastNameFirst":"Varo Remedios","birthDay":"/Date(-1926374400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-196732800000)/","birthDayAsString":"December 16, 1908","deathDayAsString":"October 8, 1963","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/788c9acc-ce34-4650-8a8e-9afd848530fd.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remedios_Varo","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7250","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7208","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Remedios Varo Uranga was one of the few acknowledged female surrealist painters of the first half of the 20th century. She defied the male dominated artistic world of that era through her unique and peculiar approach to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. The stepping stones for her original form of Surrealism were set early in her childhood and adolescence, fuelled by a multicultural background and upbringing.  Also, the great influence was her father, who instilled some core values in her, such as her ardent perfectionism, and the freedom of thought, which later took shape in her artwork.\n\nVaro’s father, an engineer by profession, nurtured his daughter’s artistic potential by mentoring her in developing technical drawing skills. He also opened the doorway to her vivid imagination by presenting her with fantasy and adventure books. Being influenced in a technical and philosophical manner by her father, and spiritually by her deeply religious mother, Varo was torn between the two worlds. Therefore, she  found herself drifting toward Surrealism and adopting it as the style, in which she would express the struggles of her inner world.\n\nIn her paintings, Varo found a safe place to revolt against Catholic practices from her maternal side, which the artist found quite restricting. She combined mystical beings and utopic machines together to give birth to her unique and enchanting style. The artist adopted mysticism and the occult as her main theme, and dismissed Christian and religious symbolism (trending leitmotifs of surrealist artists of the time, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali]Salvador Dali[/url] in his later work, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-ernst]Max Ernst[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-ernst/crucifixion-1913][i]Crucifixion[/i][/url] or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/victor-brauner]Victor Brauner[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/victor-brauner/adam-eve-1923][i]Adam & Eve[/i][/url]).\n\nThrough her art, Varo expressed her feminist beliefs and her need to oppose the superiority of male artists of that era. In the 1920s and 1930s, female painters were not fully recognized as true artists by the male counterparts and therefore, Varo and her fellow female surrealists struggled to win a place in the spotlight on a scene dominated by men. Throughout her career, viewers can find the recurring motif of the confined woman - an imprisonment of the female characters in dark or isolated spaces, hidden from the outside world. Another symbol that appears constantly is the crescent moon - an element that symbolizes the feminine aspect, and also the shadowy and introverted nature of the painter, who tried to make the viewer feel what it was like to be a female artist in the early 20th century.\n\nVaro’s signature techniques were a juxtaposition of elements, a fumage (common technique of surrealist artists, such as Wolfgang Paalen and Salvador Dali, that allows the painter to charge the canvas with a mystical atmosphere), a utopic composition, and use of well-balanced colors and contrasts. To mark her presence on a canvas, Varo built androgynous looking characters with facial features that resembled her own. By juxtaposing nature versus machine, and feelings versus logic, the artist built a multidimensional world where she could fully express the multiple aspects of herself, interweaving the woman artist, the mystic, scientist, and spiritual being all into one.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"María de los Remedios Alicia Rodriga Varo y Uranga","relatedArtists":["57726dededc2cb3880b53c4f","57726ddbedc2cb3880b520a7","57726dadedc2cb3880b4d819","57726d89edc2cb3880b497dd","57726da4edc2cb3880b4c833","57726deeedc2cb3880b53e38","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e4d9","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bc76","57726dbcedc2cb3880b4efc7","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bf2d","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4bb58","57726d7bedc2cb3880b47a63","57726deeedc2cb3880b53e88","57726da9edc2cb3880b4d1c1","57726dd1edc2cb3880b510ee","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bd87","57726da3edc2cb3880b4c68e","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c646","57726dededc2cb3880b53d7a","57726daaedc2cb3880b4d371"]},{"id":"57726d89edc2cb3880b49735","artistName":"Paul Delvaux","url":"paul-delvaux","lastNameFirst":"Delvaux Paul","birthDay":"/Date(-2280700800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(774662400000)/","birthDayAsString":"September 23, 1897","deathDayAsString":"July 20, 1994","image":"https://uploads.wikiart.org/Content/images/ARTIST-480x600.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Delvaux","dictionaries":["57726b50edc2cb3880ad7278","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Paul Delvaux was a Belgian artist known for his oil paintings that merge the elements of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url] with classical forms. A reoccurring theme in Delvaux’s work are nude women, in various positions, wandering silently through classical buildings or train stations, combined with motifs such as skeletons, characters from Jules Verne novels, men wearing bowler hats, and other unexpected objects. Deeply influenced by the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-de-chirico]Giorgio de Chirico[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rene-magritte]René Magritte[/url], Delvaux’s scenes are characterized by long shadows and a distinct sense of anxiety and unease.\n\nDelvaux was interested in exploring humanity and the subconscious. While he initially found inspiration in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism]Expressionism[/url], his mature style was mainly influenced by the Surrealist movement. During the 1930’s Delvaux began exploring a technique Surrealists developed for making poetry. This technique of convulsive joining, similar to automatism but with a higher level of order, was practiced by Surrealists in order to create collage poetry by cutting and reconfiguring the text. Delvaux pursued the idea of finding a visual equivalent to this technique. He achieved this by merging together subjects, places, and ideas that were unrelated to each other. In doing so, he created bizarre new worlds infused with a strong sense of nostalgia, alienation, and a feeling of sadness for the loss of childlike imaginative freedom.\n\nDespite the fact that Delvaux maintained a professional and personal relationship with many Surrealist painters including André Breton, René Magritte, and Paul Eluard, he remained independent and did not consider himself a Surrealist. Moreover, Delvaux claimed to find Freud's psychoanalytic ideas, that shaped the Surrealist movement, unimportant for his work. After his visit to Italy in the late 1930’s, architecture became much more than just a background in his paintings. The classical buildings he came across on his voyage, the city squares, and his lifelong obsession of train stations became a stage for his mysterious scenes, essential to achieving their specific moods. The contrasting paleness of the naked bodies against the architecture brought to light contradictory elements: public and private sphere, living bodies and the cold inanimate stone, and the estranged and the erotic side of his painted figures. This contrast was even more enhanced with the appearance of a man wearing a bowler hat (influence of R. Magritte) alongside the nudes.\n\nThe post-war years saw the re-emergence of Delvaux‘s childhood obsessions. His fear of skeletons turned into fascination. As well as his nudes, Delvaux purposely made the skeletons appear out of place in his unusual framework. He showed them in lifelike poses, reclining or lingering, believing that they brought a sense of life and time when connected with his imaginative settings. His childhood love of trams and trains also appeared in many of his later works, so much so, that it earned him the nickname \"The Painter of Stations.\"\n\nIn later life, Delvaux received many distinctions while still continuing to execute important works. From the early 1950’s he created a number of large murals in Belgium (at the Palais des Congrès, at the Liège Institute of Zoology, and in the Bourse station in Brussels). Delvaux was named the president and director of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/acad-mie-royale-des]Académie Royale des Beaux-Art[/url]s in Belgium and in 1973, he was awarded the Rembrandt Prize of the Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Stiftung. In his final years, his vision became so poor that he was forced to give up painting.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Paul

War (Der Krieg), 1924"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Otto Dix was a remarkable artist of the 20th century Germany. He occupied a lead position in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/new-objectivity-neue-sachlichkeit#!#filterName:Series_the-war,resultType:masonry]New Objectivity[/url] movement, turning away from the ideas of [url href=]Romanticism[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism#!#filterName:Series_the-war,resultType:masonry]Expressionism[/url] toward a more acidic and non-sentimental perspective to reflect the harsh realities of the interwar German society. Though being a representative of the anti-expressionist movement, Dix incorporated numerous styles into his paintings and etchings, including Expressionism. His works were also influenced by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/dada#!#filterName:Series_the-war,resultType:masonry]Dadaism[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism#!#filterName:Series_the-war,resultType:masonry]Cubism[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/futurism#!#filterName:Series_the-war,resultType:masonry]Futurism[/url], all of which shaped the artist’s satirical and savage style. \n\nDix’s story started in his hometown of Gera (1906), where his arts and crafts apprenticeship began with his teacher, Carl Senff, giving life to Otto’s first landscapes. Shortly after finishing his apprentice studies, he applied to Dresden’s Academy for crafts and arts, as industrial crafts were greatly valued by the society of the pre-war era to the detriment of the fine arts. An important part of Dix’s vision was shaped in the First World War, as the artist volunteered to take part and actually earned distinctions fighting in the trenches. He documented the years of war by sending postcards which depicted the macabre fighting scenes, bombarded lands, and shell-shocked comrades.\n\nAs the artist described himself, he was a realist, and had an acute need to experience everything first hand, before he could transpose or convey any message within his paintings. He took a surprisingly detached approach to the trauma of the trenches, depicted thoroughly in his paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/otto-dix/the-skat-players-1920][i]The Skat Players[/i][/url] (1920), but also subsequently in the etching collection titled [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/otto-dix/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-war,resultType:masonry][i]Der Krieg[/i][/url] (1924). Even though the artist was in the first line of fire in the World War I, he managed to find beauty in terror and destruction, and even to bring excitement where others would only see horrors of war. Dix was named a patron of the grotesque, but he embraced it and continued to expose the immorality and lack of ethics of the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe artist wished to portray the decay of the post-war life, as German bourgeoisie struggled through high inflation, unemployment, and the macabre display of war cripples and mutilated veterans. Frequent themes that the artist covered in his work, in his time, are the “fair ladies” of the time, often depicted nude, and their defects exaggerated to the point of caricature ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/otto-dix/memory-of-the-halls-of-mirrors-in-brussels][i]Memory of the Halls of Mirrors in Brussels[/i][/url], 1920), soldiers mutilated in the war ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/otto-dix/pragerstrasse-1920][i]Prague Street[/i][/url], 1920) or the horrific aftermaths of the battlefields ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/otto-dix/crater-field-near-dontrien-lit-up-by-flares][i]Crater field near Dontrien[/i][/url], 1924) and also depravity of the Weimar society ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/otto-dix/metropolis][i]Metropolis[/i][/url], 1927-1928). As the dark days of the Nazis coming to power grew closer, Dix’s notoriety from the 1920’s fell apart, and his artworks were stripped of value and censored by the regime. He was removed from his position of university professor at [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/dresden-academy-of-fine-arts-dresden-germany#!#resultType:masonry]Dresden Academy of Fine Arts[/url], and his work was included in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/degenerate-art#!#resultType:masonry]Entartete Kunst[/url] (degenerate art) show, where all artworks that were not within the lines of the Nazi standards were displayed.\n\nDuring the World War II, Dix had to tone down his characteristic style. He  concentrated more on landscapes, to fit the requirements of the Fuhrer's laws. The artist was commissioned to fight again when the war was almost over, and was later imprisoned by the French. Coming home to a two-sided Germany, where the art world was bound by politics, Otto was torn between his professional relations in the East, and his home in the West. While Eastern Germany turned to the socialist aspect of art, focused on the labor theme, the Western Germany art world shifted toward the United States and new art movements, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism#!#resultType:masonry]Abstract Expressionism[/url]. In a world where he did not fit anymore, Dix struggled to sell his art, as a sharp, distorted edge of his realistic style became blunt.\n\nOtto Dix is regarded as a pivotal figure for the New Objectivity movement in Germany, who had the courage to portray the uncensored versions of two harsh wars and a bleak, depraved society in between, using his satirical and grotesque characters and themes to make a direct statement through his artwork.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Wilhelm Heinrich Otto Dix","relatedArtists":["57726d86edc2cb3880b490ab","57726d87edc2cb3880b492b2","59ecaa01edc2c98ae46c7282","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dbd8","57726d87edc2cb3880b492b2","57726dacedc2cb3880b4d5da","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a36f","57726ddbedc2cb3880b5219c","57726dd4edc2cb3880b5152e","59352f15edc2c97fa8fdf312","57726df3edc2cb3880b546c2","57726d87edc2cb3880b491ed","57726ddeedc2cb3880b526ba","57726d8dedc2cb3880b49f14","57726decedc2cb3880b53bd2","57726ddfedc2cb3880b52866","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f87c","57726dfbedc2cb3880b55213","57726d8dedc2cb3880b49f42","57726d98edc2cb3880b4b3a3"]},{"id":"5e7a1ec2edc2c9dd4cb5b68a","artistName":"Adalbert Schaffer","url":"adalbert-schaffer","lastNameFirst":"Schaffer Adalbert","birthDay":"/Date(-4891363200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-3124137600000)/","birthDayAsString":"1815","deathDayAsString":"1871","image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/00281/images/adalbert-schaffer/hampel-55107004.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726a66edc2ca38801d4cc9","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7248","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7298","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f20"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"592ba050edc2c922acf77c2b","artistName":"Kaloust Guedel","url":"kaloust-guedel","lastNameFirst":"Guedel Kaloust","birthDay":"/Date(-415584000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"October 31, 1956","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00134/images//200.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaloust_Guedel","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad7220","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f59","592b9c40edc2c9614c100001","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e78","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f79","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f00"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"[b][/b][b][/b][b][/b]Kaloust Guedel (born October 31, 1956) is a Cyprus-born American artist of Armenian descent.

In the 1860s, he worked for his family’s lumber business. Pope studied carving, painting, perspective, and anatomy with William Rimmer, an important romantic-baroque sculptor, painter, and influential teacher of many Boston artists. From 1879 to 1883, Pope created many well-received carvings of game. Czar Alexander III of Russia acquired two of the carvings. In 1893, Pope began painting animal portraits and, later, pursued a career as a portrait painter. Eventually, he was considered one of the best Bostonian trompe l’oeil painters of the nineteenth century. The French term trompe l‘oeil means deception of the eye. Trompe l’oeil paintings appear so real that they trick the viewer into thinking they are seeing an actual scene rather than a painted one.\r\nPope is particularly well known for his illusionist paintings and wood carvings of birds, rabbits, and firearms hanging on slate-colored doors.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Alexander Pope,

best known for his religious works, as well as realistic depictions of the everyday life of his times. His early work was influenced by the painters Zubaran, Jusepe de Ribera, and Alonzo Cano, who all held a realistic approach to painting, a technique which was adapted by Murillo. His work was characterized by both realism and tenebrism, or the contrast of light and shade, which he combined to make soft forms full of rich colors. His later works evolved into a polished style that fed the tastes of the Bourgeois and aristocrats of his day, and he received many commissions for them. \r\n\r\nHe also received many important commissions from the religious orders of the Franciscans and the confraternities in Seville and Andalusia. The themes that therefore gave him the greatest success were religious, being the Virgin and the Child and the Immaculate Conception.  \r\n\r\nIn his lifetime, Murillo had a great number of pupils and followers, and in 1660, he founded the Academia de Bellas Artes in Seville, Spain. Until the 19th century, he was the only Spanish artist widely known in the European world, and his work was subsequently imitated, ensuring his fame throughout Spain and in Europe.

Plaisted Abbott was born in Lincoln, Maine in the year 1875. Abott would study at several different art schools including the Philadelphia Design School for Women (now Moore College of Art & Design), the Drexel Institue (now Drexel University), the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (PAFA), and the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Her rigorous dedication to learning would prove fruitful to her long-lasting career. Abbott would earn insurmountable success as an illustrator, and be known as one of the most prolific illustrators of illustration's Golden Age. \n\nSome of Abbott's clients included [i]Scribner’s, Saturday Evening Post, and Harper’s Magazine.[/i] And she even worked beyond this in picture book illustration. Abbott's illustrations for a new edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's [i]Treasure Island[/i] are a prime example of the influence of her former mentor, Howard Pyle. Later in her life, Abbott remarked her favorite pieces were created under his guidance. Abbott was a member of the Plastic Club in Philadelphia, an all-female sketch club that was created in response to the exclusionary men's club, the Philadelphia Sketch Club. \n\nAbbott married C.Yarnall Abbott and in 1907, they had one child, a daughter, Marjorie “Peggy” Abbott. Abbott's work is currently on display at the Brandywine River Museum.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Elenore Plaisted

From 1911 he began to sculpt in the Cubist style after meeting Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Juan Gris and Fernand Léger.\r\n\r\nMulti-talented, Laurens worked with poster paint, and collage, was an engraver and created theatre design and decoration. In 1915 he illustrated a book for his friend, the author Pierre Reverdy.\r\n\r\nIn 1938 he shared an exhibition with Braque and Picasso that travelled to major Scandinavian cities. In 1947, he made prints for book illustrations. In 1948 he exhibited his art at the important international Venice Biennale. That same year, he exhibited at the Galerie d'Art Moderne in Basel, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nA great many of his sculptures are massive objects. An example of this style is the monumental piece L'Amphion, created in 1952 for the Central University of Venezuela, Caracas after a request from the architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva.\r\n\r\nMulti-talented, Laurens worked with poster paint and collage was an engraver and creasted theatre design and decoration.

Throughout his prolific career, he has demonstrated tremendous artistic range, shifting between figurative and abstract painting. Richter was born in 1932 in Dresden, Germany. As a child, he experienced the bombing of Dresden by the Allied Forces in 1945. Afterward, he remembered roaming around and exploring the ruins. It proved to be an important event in Richter’s life, and he alluded to the experience in two separate series: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/all-works#!#filterName:Series_aeroplanes,resultType:masonry]a 1963-64 series that depicted military aircraft[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/all-works#!#filterName:Series_townscapes,resultType:masonry]a series of townscapes[/url] that he painted in the late 1960s.\n\nRichter spent his early years under two oppressive regimes, the Third Reich and the communist government that ruled East Germany after World War II. Between 1951 and 1956, Richter studied painting at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/dresden-academy-of-fine-arts-dresden-germany]Fine Arts Academy in Dresden[/url], which mostly followed the principles of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/social-realism]Social Realism[/url]. In 1961, only a few months before the erection of the Berlin Wall, Richter managed to defect to West Germany. He continued his studies [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/kunstakademie-dusseldorf-dusseldorf-germany]in Düsseldorf[/url]. There he met the artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke]Sigmar Polke[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/konrad-lueg]Konrad Lueg[/url], Manfred Kuttner, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/blinky-palermo]Blinky Palermo[/url]. In 1963, together with Polke, Lueg, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/manfred-kuttner]Kuttner, Richter[/url] founded the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/capitalist-realism]Capitalist Realism[/url] group, whose works came to be known as German [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop Art[/url]. During this period, Richter created paintings that were based on photographs he collected, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/party-1963][i]Party[/i][/url] (1963) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/women-descending-the-staircase-1965][i]Women Descending the Staircase[/i][/url] (1965). His collection of photographs would later develop into an archive of sorts that the artist called [i]Atlas[/i]. Like most of his photo-paintings, [i]Party[/i] and [i]Women Descending the Staircase[/i] have a photographic source that can be found in [i]Atlas[/i].\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, Richter felt that he exhausted his photographic inspirations and began exploring an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/abstract-art]abstract style[/url] of painting. Throughout the years, Richter periodically experimented with several kinds of abstraction: color chart paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/1024-colours-1973][i]1024 colors[/i][/url] (1973), grey monochromes like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/grey][i]Grey[/i][/url] (1973), and colorful, gestural abstracts like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/abstract-painting-599-1986][i]Abstract Painting No.599[/i][/url] (1986). In the late 1980s, Richter took on the controversial subject of the deaths of the leaders of the German terrorist group, Baader-Meinhof, in the series [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/all-works#!#filterName:Series_18-oktober-1977-1988,resultType:masonry][i]18 Oktober 1977[/i][/url]. The paintings were based on published photographs, to which he later applied different painterly effects that obscured the images, as in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/funeral-1988][i]Funeral[/i][/url] (1988). Richter never shied away from political subjects, although h[i][/i]e maintained that his paintings were not political statements. Instead, it seems that Richter’s main concern was to present complex issues and highlight their challenging aspects.\n\nRichter’s later works expanded to a wide range of subjects: portraits of family and friends, still-life and landscapes. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/betty][i]Betty[/i][/url] (1988), a portrait of his daughter turning away from the viewer, signified Germany’s preoccupation with its past, as well as present struggles in establishing its identity. In 2007, Richter completed one of his most ambitious commissions, the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/cologne-cathedral-window-2007][i]Cologne Cathedral Window[/i][/url] (2007). He based the design of the stained glass window on his color chart painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/4096-colours-1974][i]4096 colors[/i][/url] (1974).

In October 2019, he felt a strong impulse to paint, and between October 2019 – February 2020, he has created over 50 works of art on canvas and paper. Holt says that all of his art is a meditation that comes to him through his subconscious.\n\nHolt believes that his paintings include unique symbols which cannot be traced to any past culture.

Baziotes was an American painter influenced by Surrealism and was a contributor to Abstract Expressionism.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Greek parents Angelos and Stella, Baziotes began his formal art training in 1933 at the National Academy of Design in New York City where he graduated in 1936. He studied with Charles Curran, Ivan Olinsky, Gifford Beal, and Leon Kroll. Baziotes taught through the Federal Art Project in from 1936-1938 and worked on their WPA Easel Project from 1938-1940.\r\n\r\nIn the 1940s he became friends with many artists in the emerging Abstract Expressionist group. Although he shared the groups' interest in primitive art and automatism, his work was more in line with European surrealism Later in his career he taught extensively. His first solo exhibition was at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century Gallery in 1944. With David Hare, Robert Motherwell, and Mark Rothko, Baziotes founded the Subjects of the Artist School in New York in 1948. He also taught at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, People's Art Center, the Museum of Modern Art, and at the City University of New York, Hunter College and New York University in Manhattan during the last ten years of his life.\r\n\r\nBaziotes and his wife Ethel, whom he married in 1941, lived in the Morningside Heights area of northern Manhattan until his death from cancer in June 1963, aged 50. During his lifetime, he and his wife shared a love of ancient Greek art and sculpture as well as the poetry of Charles Baudelaire. Many of his paintings are inspired by the latter's poetry as well as by ancient art.

He was born in New York to Jewish parents. From 1920-1921 he studied at the Art Students League of New York, after which he traveled in France and Germany for a year. Before his skills had fully developed he studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris. When he returned, he was one of the most traveled New York Artists. In the mid-1930s, he became a teacher using his acquired technical and art history knowledge to teach while he painted.\r\n\r\nAfter his 1930’s one man show he won respect amongst his peers. In 1935, he and nine others, including Ben-Zion, Ilya Bolotowsky, Louis Harris, Jack Kufeld, Mark Rothko, and Louis Schanker, known as “The Ten” exhibited their works together until 1940. They would come to be known as the Abstract Expressionists.\r\n\r\nFrom 1937-1939, Gottlieb lived in the Arizona desert, and taking the cue from his environment he painted cacti and barren scenery. He transitioned from this into more Surrealist works like the Sea Chest which displays mysterious incongruities on an otherwise normal landscape. He expresses space most fully in his mature works. It is then that he conveys to the viewer the expansiveness he must have felt looking at Arizona desert sky, although he distills this expansiveness into a more basic abstract form.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Gottlieb encountered exiled Surrealists in New York and they added to and reaffirmed his belief in the subconscious as the well for evocative and universal art. This belief led him to experiment with basic and elemental symbols. The results of his experiments manifested themselves in his series “Pictographs” which spanned from 1941-1950. In his painting Voyager’s Return, he juxtaposes these symbols in compartmentalized spaces. His symbols reflect those of indigenous populations of North America and the Ancient Near East. However, once he found out one of his symbols was not original, he no longer used it. He wanted his symbols to have the same impact on all his viewers, striking a chord not because they had seen it before, but because it was so basic and elemental that it resounded within them.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s he began his new series Imaginary Landscapes he retained his usage of a ‘pseudo-language,’ but added the new element of space. He was not painting landscapes in the traditional sense, rather he modified that genre to match his own style of painting. He painted simple figures in the foreground, and simple figures in the background, and the viewer can read the depth. He also designed a series of 18 windows for the Kingsway Jewish Center.\r\n\r\nIn his last series Burst which started in 1957, he simplifies his representation down to two shapes discs and winding masses. His paintings are variations with these elements arranged in different ways. This series, unlike the Imaginary Landscape series, suggests a basic landscape with a sun and a ground. On another level, the shapes are so rudimentary; they are not limited to this one interpretation. Gottlieb was a masterful colorist as well and in the Burst series his use of color is particularly crucial. He is considered one of the first color field painters and is one of the forerunners of Lyrical Abstraction. Gottlieb’s career was marked by the evolution of space and universality. Gottlieb had a stroke in 1970, but continued on with his painting and worked on the Burst series until his death in 1974.

In this respect, Azaria Mbatha (qv.), who favoured the medium, influenced Muafangejo as did many other artists who studied at Rorke’s Drift. In addition, the relative inexpensiveness of the medium and the fact that it does not require sophisticated printing equipment made it an attractive and feasible option for many black printmakers. But, like many others, when Muafangejo had access to the necessary equipment and materials, he produced an impressive body of woodcuts and intaglio prints. In intaglio, he seldom used etching on its own, preferring to combine it with aquatint (for tonal areas) and he was particularly adept in the use of drypoint – where the image is scratched directly into the plate. The immediacy and vividness of drypoint proved a sympathetic medium for his images.\n\nIn his prints Muafangejo used a clear and unambiguous language – he could literally and figuratively tell a story in black-and-white, and there is always a strong narrative component in his work. Characteristically, a dramatic incident often forms the subject of his prints with the ‘characters’ in the story dispersed over the sheet, occupying a shallow space. This narrative is often extended, with text incorporated into the print. Text at times becomes so important that the print resembles a page from a medieval illuminated manuscript.\n\nSome commentators have seen Muafangejo as ‘naïve’ and ‘primitive’ – but this is far from true. He, in fact, produced work which comments with subtlety and insight on the world around him. Although direct references to contemporary political events are rare, his work does refer – if obliquely – to the repressive regime at the time, and he often used Zulu and Ovambo history to provide an indirect comment in this regard. Religious subjects feature prominently in his work, reflecting his strong religious background. But, even here, Muafangejo also commented on the political and social role of the Church in resisting and opposing an inhumane and unjust regime.\n\nMany of his prints are of an autobiographical nature and refer to dramatic or humorous incidents in his life. But the references to his personal life are mediated by a gentle humour and an objectivity which transcends the merely anecdotal. The lucky artist, a linocut of 1974, (plate 180) was conceived after the announcement on Radio Owambo that Muafangejo had won a silver cup for an exhibition. Muafangejo did not know for which exhibition he had won the award, but decided to celebrate by making this print. This was just as well, for in the end, he did not receive a cup at all! Although very disappointed, Muafangejo, typically, does not show this in his print. In a relatively short working career he produced an impressive body of work which has influenced generations of printmakers in Southern Africa.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"John Ndevasia Muafangejo","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"5dbdb8f4edc2c9e054a213e1","artistName":"TAMÁS, Ervin","url":"tamas-ervin","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(-1514764800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(820454400000)/","birthDayAsString":"1922","deathDayAsString":"1996","image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00261/images//img-20191102-0001-2.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4e69","57726b4dedc2cb3880ad6de8","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7298","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d01","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f28"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1948,"activeYearsCompletion":1996,"biography":"TAMAS, Ervin's art is constructed with plots of colors, his compositions have an exact geometry, but at the same time they have a remarkable ease and casualness.

Warren (born 1951) is a contemporary figurative painter who has exhibited extensively throughout the U.S. and abroad, notably in the 1981 Whitney Biennial and the 1984 Venice Biennale. A painter in the Neo-Expressionist style, he has drawn inspiration from Spanish masters such as Velázquez, Goya and Picasso, as well as from Mexican folk art and the American southwest. Committed to his own Regionalist style during his formative years in Texas and New Mexico, he was picked up by Phyllis Kind in 1981. During those years he transitioned to a style characterized by \"magical realism\", and his work came to rely on symbol allegory, and unusual shifts in scale. Throughout his career, his paintings and prints have featured flat figures, jagged shadows, and semi-autobiographical content. His oil paintings layer paint, often incorporate collage, and usually contain either figures or horses juxtaposed in strange tableaux.(1)","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Russ

mainly in the spectrum of portrait and compositional works, Petros Malayan also devoted some of his time to illustrative and printed graphics. He illustrated an impressive collection of books by Armenian as well as foreign writers. His art works are defined by precise drawing technique, a tasteful color palette and great taste in aesthetics. Whatever the subject, his works show refreshing excitement about contemporary life and his love for depicting the average ‘working-class’ man. He crossed many roads and byways, from Kadjaran on the Arpa-Sevan construction project, to the shores of Enisey and lakes of Siberia. Travel gave the artist new perspectives and impressions – with every new meeting and at every new point of arrival.\n \nThroughout the 1950s  and up until early 1990th, he successfully combined his own creative work with teaching at the Yerevan State Institute of Arts, giving lectures to young students on methods of teaching drawing, and on the importance of drawing as the base component of any art.\n \nPetros Malayan’s works are exhibited in the National Art Gallery of Armenia, various museums in Russia, Bulgaria, Poland and can be found in some private collections. Artist’s collection counts over 300 aquarelles, portraits and graphic works. His first post-mortum retrospective exhibition opened in Yerevan, Armenia in 2002.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Պետրոս

From the tones, elements, feelings and experiences of these journeys, he conjures complimentary forms flowing through the medium of paint into a distinctly personal, visual language.

Harlem, New York to Bermudian parents. Always interested in art, he had amassed a large art history library by the time he was a young man. A lifelong resident of Harlem, he also traveled extensively during the two years that he worked on ocean freighters. An important early influence was the sculptor and teacher Augusta Savage, who provided him with open studio space at her Harlem Community Art Center. He also participated in WPA art projects, alongside Jackson Pollock, among others.\nLewis began his career in 1933, with earlier mostly figurative work. He at first painted what he saw, which ranged from Meeting Place (1930), a swap meet scene, and The Yellow Hat (1936), a formal Cubist painting, to Dispossessed (1940), an eviction scene, and Jazz Musicians (1948), a visual depiction of the bebop that was being played in Harlem.\nHe also painted social realism, painting with \"an overtly figurative style, depicting bread lines, evictions, and police brutality.\"[1]\nLewis said he struggled to express social conflict in his art, but in his later years, focused on the inherently aesthetic. \"The goal of the artist must be aesthetic development,\" he told art historian Kellie Jones, \"and in a universal sense, to make in his own way some contribution to culture.\nNorman Lewis was the only African- American artist among the first generation of Abstract Expressionists. As was expressed in the segment about him on the March 20, 2016 television show \"Sunday Morning\" (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/reappraising-the-art-of-norman-lewis/), his work was overlooked by both White and African-American art dealers and gallery owners. He did not fit into either category perfectly. As was recently noted in a catalogue accompanying a major retrospective of Lewis's paintings this omission seem clear enough.[3]\nHis work was overlooked many times because of his political involvement, and also because of the area where he lived. His skin colour at this time period had a major impact on his work life.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Norman Wilfred Lewis","relatedArtists":["57726d9fedc2cb3880b4bf5a","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bd0f","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b5ba","57726d9dedc2cb3880b4bc76","57726db8edc2cb3880b4e8f9","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a348","57726dc3edc2cb3880b4faa5","57726dc8edc2cb3880b5022f","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c646","57726d7aedc2cb3880b478b9","57726ddaedc2cb3880b5200b","57726dd2edc2cb3880b51248","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c3d4","57726dd9edc2cb3880b51e3e","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4b9e9","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c451","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f32d","57726dd2edc2cb3880b511a9","57726dccedc2cb3880b5092a","57726dd3edc2cb3880b51432"]},{"id":"57726db7edc2cb3880b4e723","artistName":"Ipolit Strambu","url":"ipolit-strambu","lastNameFirst":"Strambu Ipolit","birthDay":"/Date(-3117571200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-1109894400000)/","birthDayAsString":"March 18, 1871","deathDayAsString":"October 31, 1934","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/82a9612f-40f5-4bae-a8c1-bc21bcd2fe96.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipolit_Str%C3%A2mbu","dictionaries":["57726a67edc2ca38801d4d29","57726b50edc2cb3880ad72a0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Ipolit Strâmbu (Strâmbescu; Hipolit; Strâmbulescu)","relatedArtists":["57726d91edc2cb3880b4a7a2","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cda2","57726d95edc2cb3880b4ad14","5b5851d5edc2c918c8d3a7a3","57726db5edc2cb3880b4e4f1","57726e05edc2cb3880b56291","57726dbaedc2cb3880b4ec99","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e643","57726de0edc2cb3880b5291b","57726dd3edc2cb3880b513d7","57726d94edc2cb3880b4abd4","57726dd3edc2cb3880b512bc","57726d83edc2cb3880b489d8","5ba906f5edc2cc18b4558ad5","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cd69","5abb12aeedc2c9d7d8cac49e","57726da3edc2cb3880b4c6c5","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a43b","586f5aa1edc2c968c8466ffa","57726d98edc2cb3880b4b3d3"]},{"id":"57726da8edc2cb3880b4cf95","artistName":"Giorgio Morandi","url":"giorgio-morandi","lastNameFirst":"Morandi Giorgio","birthDay":"/Date(-2507241600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-174787200000)/","birthDayAsString":"July 20, 1890","deathDayAsString":"June 18, 1964","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/86bedd7f-b4c2-43b7-9bc0-8779b2f9c64d.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Morandi","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e21","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e19","57726b4bedc2cb3880ad6890","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f20"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Giorgio Morandi","relatedArtists":["57726d7cedc2cb3880b47b1a","57726d7fedc2cb3880b48109","57726d80edc2cb3880b48351","57726d84edc2cb3880b48a5b","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dbc0","57726d7fedc2cb3880b48109","57726dafedc2cb3880b4d9dc","57726dacedc2cb3880b4d5da","57726d97edc2cb3880b4b0e4","57726db3edc2cb3880b4e075","597c5ef4edc2c979bc89648b","57726ddbedc2cb3880b52063","57726d97edc2cb3880b4b225","57726ddbedc2cb3880b5204b","57726dd8edc2cb3880b51d2c","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a277","57726db0edc2cb3880b4dbc0","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f7df","57726ddcedc2cb3880b52303","57726dffedc2cb3880b55845"]},{"id":"57726dd5edc2cb3880b517a9","artistName":"Kay Sage","url":"kay-sage","lastNameFirst":"Sage Kay","birthDay":"/Date(-2256940800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-220320000000)/","birthDayAsString":"June 25, 1898","deathDayAsString":"January 8, 1963","image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/kay-sage.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Sage","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e11"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Katherine Linn Sage","relatedArtists":["57726d82edc2cb3880b48668","57726d83edc2cb3880b488b2","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f22e","57726d89edc2cb3880b49735","57726ddbedc2cb3880b520bb","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f25e","57726dc2edc2cb3880b4fa07","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e560","57726dabedc2cb3880b4d532","57726d7cedc2cb3880b47b8c","57726dededc2cb3880b53d65","57726dd4edc2cb3880b51586","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f2e9","57726d98edc2cb3880b4b3a3","57726db4edc2cb3880b4e324","57726d87edc2cb3880b49265","57726dd6edc2cb3880b51945","57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bdb3","57726da6edc2cb3880b4cbdb","57726dd2edc2cb3880b51278"]},{"id":"57726da4edc2cb3880b4c8fd","artistName":"Adnan Coker","url":"adnan-coker","lastNameFirst":"Coker Adnan","birthDay":"/Date(-1356998400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1927","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/68446bf7-1cef-4099-a5ad-25ed23425a4d.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Coker","dictionaries":["5804eadaedc2ce45b4e01a76","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d81","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7368"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Adnan Çoker is a Turkish abstract artist.

Gorky was an American painter of Armenian descent who played a crucial role in the development of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]Abstract Expressionism[/url]. Originally named Vosdanig Adoian, Gorky was born in 1904 in the small village on the eastern border of the Ottoman Empire. Gorky was only a teenager when the Ottoman forces began the ethnic cleansing of the Armenian people. Even though Gorky and his family survived the Armenian genocide, his mother died of malnourishment shortly after. In 1920, Gorky immigrated with his sister to the United States. Little is known about his early years there, but the young man was determined to reinvent himself. He changed his name to Arshile Gorky, playing the role of a Russian noble and claiming to be a relative of the Russian writer, Maxim Gorky (which was impossible because Maxim Gorky was a pseudonym used by the writer Alexei Peshkov).\n\nIn 1924 Gorky settled permanently in New York. Even though he enrolled in several art classes, he was mostly self-taught, copying artworks in museums and galleries and reading art publications. Gorky paid particular attention to European modern art and was especially captivated by the paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Paul Cézanne[/url]. His early painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/staten-island][i]Staten Island[/i][/url] (1927) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/pears-peaches-and-pitcher-1927][i]Pears, Peaches, and Pitcher[/i][/url] (1926-1927) demonstrated his full commitment to learning and emulating Cezanne’s style. \n\nAt the same time, Gorky began to reconnect with his past and Armenian roots. One of his most notable paintings, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artist-with-his-mother-1936][i]The Artist and His Mother[/i][/url] (1926-1936), was based on an old photograph taken in 1912 in Armenia. The emotional portrait expressed the artist’s personal sense of loss, but it also became a symbol of the tragedy of the Armenian genocide. From the late 1920s and during the 1930s, Gorky continued his artistic development by emulating the styles of European painters, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro]Joan Miró[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/fernand-leger]Fernand Léger[/url]. He was often criticized for lack of originality and his tendency to become immersed in someone else’s style. However, his method eventually allowed him to synthesize all of the techniques into his own highly original art.\n\nIn the late 1930s and 1940s, Gorky came into contact with several prominent members of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealist[/url] groups active in the New York art scene. He also developed friendships with Surrealist poet [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/man-ray/andr%C3%A9-breton-1930]André Breton[/url] and the Chilean born artist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roberto-matta]Roberto Matta[/url]. These connections led Gorky to further experiments with surrealist concepts and to the creation of his original abstract language. \n\nDuring this time, he met and married Agnes Magruder, whom he affectionately called ‘Mougouch’. The couple spent a lot of time at her parent’s home in rural Virginia, and later they lived in Sherman, Connecticut. It was a significant turning point for Gorky: he had a chance to reconnect with nature, and many elements of the American landscape reminded him of his native home in Armenia. He channeled this energy into vibrant paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-liver-is-the-cock-s-comb][i]The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i][/url] (1944) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/water-of-the-flowery-mill][i]Water of the Flowery Mill[/i][/url] (1944). Unfortunately, the following years were marked by turmoil: personal difficulties and health problems led Gorky to commit suicide on July 21st, 1948. Although he was only 44, his art left a profound impact, serving as a link between European modernism and American Abstract Expressionism.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Vostanik Manuk Adoyan

She belonged to a group called 'The Five' and the paintings or diagrams were a visual representation of complex philosophical ideas.\r\n\r\nThe fourth child of Captain Victor af Klint, a Swedish naval commander, and Mathilda af Klint (née Sonntag), Hilma af Klint spent summers with her family at their farm Hammora on the island of Adelsö in Lake Mälaren. In these idylic surroundings Hilma came into contact with nature at an early stage in her life and this deep association with natural forms was to be an inspiration in her work. From her father she adopted an interest in mathematics.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 her younger sister Hermina died and it was at this time that the spiritual dimension of her life began to develop.\r\n\r\nShe showed an early ability in visual art and after the family had moved to Stockholm she studied at the Academy of Fine Arts for five years during which time she learned portraiture and landscape painting . Here she met Anna Cassel, the first of the four women with whom she later worked in 'The Five' (de fem), a group of artists who shared her ideas. Her more conventional painting became the source of her financial income while the 'life's work' remained a quite separate practice.\r\n\r\nThe project on which \"the Five\" were engaged involved, in 1892, recording in a book a completely new system of mystical thought in the form of messages from higher spirits. One, Gregor, spoke thus: \"all the knowledge that is not of the senses, not of the intellect, not of the heart but is the property that exclusively belongs to the deepest aspect of your being...the knowledge of your spirit\".\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that af Klint's work ran parallel to the development of abstract art by other artists such as Mondrian, Malevich and Kandinsky who were, like af Klint, inspired by the Theosophical Movement founded by Madame Blavatsky. Af Klint's work can also be seen in the wider context of the modernist search for new forms in artistic, spiritual, political and scientific systems in the beginnings of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nThrough her work with the group 'the Five' af Klint created experimental automatic drawing as early as 1896, leading her towards an inventive geometric visual language capable of conceptualising invisible forces both of the inner and outer worlds. Quite apart from their diagrammatic purpose the paintings have a freshness and a modern aesthetic of tentative line and hastily captured image: a segmented circle, a helix bisected and divided into a spectrum of lightly painted colours. She continued prolifically to add to the body of work amounting to over 1000 pieces until 1941. She requested that it should not be shown until 20 years after the end of her life.

He produced over 4000 lithographs in his lifetime, which were known for their satires of political figures and the behavior of the bourgeois inn society. As a boy he showed an inclination towards art, which his father tried to discourage, and so he put him to work as an usher. But, Daumier’s talents could not be dissuades, and he later work at a booksellers, eventually landing in the employ of Alexandre Lenoir, an artist and archaeologist, and becoming his protégé. It was here that he began making his first attempts at lithography, and began a career producing plates for music producers and advertisement illustrations. \n\nHe began working for the comic journal La Caricature during the reign of King Louis Phillippe, and produced many caricatures outlining corruption on the law, the mistakes of the bourgeois, and the incompetence of the government. It was at this time that he published a satire of the king as Gargantua, which landed him in prison for six months, after which the journal La Caricature ceased publication. He also produced caricatures for the publication Le Chavivari, holding the bourgeois up to more scrutiny \n\nOne of his favorite themes was Don Quixote, of which he drew 49 drawings, and completed 29 paintings depicting his life. Daumier received little recognition until 1878, a year before his death, when his works were put on exhibition. Posthumously, more recognition has been placed on Daumier and his revered social commentary.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Honoré-Victorin Daumier","relatedArtists":["57726d7dedc2cb3880b47d2a","57726df7edc2cb3880b54cb9","5aaa53deedc2c96894187f33","57726d96edc2cb3880b4af41","57726df7edc2cb3880b54c61","57726d98edc2cb3880b4b35f","57726d80edc2cb3880b4836e","57726da8edc2cb3880b4cf1d","57726df7edc2cb3880b54c75","57726d7dedc2cb3880b47d2a","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4ed63","57726dacedc2cb3880b4d6b2","57726d93edc2cb3880b4ab31","57726dd7edc2cb3880b51b7a","57726d7cedc2cb3880b47b4e","57726e09edc2cb3880b582f5","57726d7eedc2cb3880b47e3f","57726db4edc2cb3880b4e1f2","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4ee3d","57726d81edc2cb3880b483d2"]},{"id":"57726df9edc2cb3880b54edf","artistName":"Howard Pyle","url":"howard-pyle","lastNameFirst":"Pyle Howard ","birthDay":"/Date(-3686688000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-1834963200000)/","birthDayAsString":"March 5, 1853","deathDayAsString":"November 9, 1911","image":"https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/howard-pyle.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Pyle","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e70","57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce9"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"57726df9edc2cb3880b54ee3","title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"},{"id":"57726df9edc2cb3880b54ee5","title":"Otto of the Silver Hand"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Howard Pyle","relatedArtists":["57726d8aedc2cb3880b4995d","5cacfcdcedc2c98c5cd76e05","5cad4054edc2c98c5ce3b250","57726dcfedc2cb3880b50d53","57726dceedc2cb3880b50d03","5b98939eedc2c9079c9624ab","57726e04edc2cb3880b56107","5ba8faf1edc2cc18b4dbf081","5c196671edc2c914808c9c18","57726dd6edc2cb3880b51931","57726dacedc2cb3880b4d556","57726e04edc2cb3880b56147","57726d7cedc2cb3880b47bc2","57726dfdedc2cb3880b554d1","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b562","5c96f2a8edc2c94394c6859b","57726d88edc2cb3880b494dd","57726de5edc2cb3880b530a1","57726d95edc2cb3880b4ad5e","596d0e3dedc2c93e30e0c0a7"]},{"id":"57726da8edc2cb3880b4cfc1","artistName":"J.

He was sent to Pieter Lastman in Amsterdam at about the age of 10 for two full years. After that he began his career as an independent artist, at about the age of 12 in Leiden.\nHe became something of a celebrity because of his talent at such a young age. Specifically, his copy of Democriet & Herakliet by Cornelis van Haarlem (illustration), and a portrait of his mother Machtelt Jans van Noortzant, were admired. This attracted the attention of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, around 1620, who bought a life-size painting of a young man reading by the light of a turf-fire. He gave this painting in turn to the English Ambassador, who presented it to James I. This was the reason why, when Lievens was 31, he was invited to the British court. When he returned from England via Calais, he settled in Antwerp, where he married Suzanna Colyn de Nole, the daughter of the sculptor Michiel Colyns, on 23 December 1638. In this period he won many commissions from royalty, mayors, and city halls. According to Houbraken, a Continence of Scipio was painted for the Leiden city hall. \nLievens collaborated and shared a studio with Rembrandt van Rijn from about 1626 to 1631. Their competitive collaboration, represented in some two dozen paintings, drawings and etchings, was intimate enough to cause difficulties in the attribution of works from this period. Lievens showed talent for painting in a life-size scale, and his dramatic compositions suggest the influence of the Caravaggisti. In Constantijn Huygens' assessment, Lievens was more inventive, yet less expressive than Rembrandt. The two men split in 1631, when Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam and Lievens to England. In 1656 Rembrandt still owned paintings by his former friend.\nDuring his time in England Lievens painted a portrait for Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, and became influenced by the works of Anthony van Dyck. Lievens worked in Antwerp, and cooperated with Adriaen Brouwer. After being a court painter in The Hague and Berlin, he returned to Amsterdam in 1655. After his first wife died he married a sister of Jan de Bray in 1648.

in Germany, [url href=https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/max_weyl_artwork.html]painter Max Weyl[/url] immigrated to Williamsport, Pennsylvania in 1853 and in 1861 moved to Washington, D.C., where he opened a jewelry store. Not trained as an artist, Weyl started painting flowers and still-lifes only as a hobby. Weyl was self-taught and was apparently too modest to display his paintings. It was not until 1870 that he began to display his artwork in the window of his jewelry store. As fate would have it, Samuel Kauffmann, president of the board of trustees of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and publisher of the “Evening Star” newspaper, brought his watch to [url href=https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/max_weyl_artwork.html]Max Weyl[/url] for repair. He was immediately taken with Weyl’s displayed artwork and bought a small landscape. Weyl’s reputation grew and he drew many Washington, D.C. patrons including the former Brazilian Ambassador, Salvador de Mendonca. In addition, Francis Cleveland, wife of U.S. President Grover Cleveland and Ellen Wilson, 1st wife of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, bought Weyl’s landscapes for the Whitehouse. Georgetown University, the Virginia Military Institute, Kiplingers Washington Editors and the Cosmos Club also purchased Weyl’s paintings. In 1879, Weyl travelled to Europe to study art in Munich, Paris, Vienna and Venice. Following his return he, with other area artists, founded the Washington Landscape School.\n\nIn addition to offering the artwork below for sale, Bedford Fine Art Gallery is also actively seeking to purchase [url href=https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/max_weyl_artwork.html]artwork by Max Weyl[/url].

He was born circa 1386 in Florence. The artist learned stone carving from one of the sculptors who worked for the Florence Cathedral around 1400. From 1404 to 1407, Donatello was part of the workshop of sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ghiberti]Lorenzo Ghiberti[/url]. The traces of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/gothic]Gothic style[/url] in his early works, like the marble statue of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/david-1409][i]David[/i][/url] (1408-1409), can be attributed to Ghiberti’s influence. The marble [i]David[/i] was originally intended for a cathedral, but in 1416 it was moved to Florence’s city hall, Palazzo Vecchio. In its new surrounding, the statue became a patriotic symbol: David’s triumph over Goliath represented the triumph of Florence over its enemies. Between 1415 and 1426, Donatello worked on five prophet statues, out of which the most well-known is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/zuccone-statue-of-the-prophet-habakkuk-1425][i]Zuccone (Statue of the Prophet Habakkuk)[/i][/url] (1425). The statue, nicknamed ‘[i]zuccone[/i]’ (pumpkin) because of the figure’s bald head, stood out for its realistic style and highly individualistic facial features.\n\nMany of Donatello’s greatest masterpieces were done in bronze. One of his early independent commissions was his first bronze relief, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/the-feast-of-herod-1427][i]The Feast of Herod[/i][/url] (1427), which was created for the baptistery of San Giovanni in the Siena Cathedral. The relief portrays the dramatic moment in which Herod is stunned by the severed head of Saint John the Baptist. The figures in the relief express intense emotional responses that help build up the tension of the dramatic scene. By adding architectural elements to the composition, Donatello demonstrated his knowledge and command of a linear perspective.\n\nOne of Donatello’s long-standing relationships was with the Medici family: from 1433 to 1443, he made decorations for San Lorenzo, the Medici Church. This commission included ten large reliefs in colored stucco and two sets of small bronze doors. In this period, he also created the bronze statue of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/david-1432][i]David[/i][/url] (ca. 1440), the first large scale free-standing nude statue of the Renaissance. Documents show that the statue was placed at the center of the Medici Palace courtyard in 1496.\n\nIn 1443, Donatello was offered a prestigious and essential commission in Padua, to create an equestrian statue for condottiere Erasmo da Narmi, known by the name Gattamelata. The project was an immense undertaking: the artist set up a studio in Padua and completed most of the work between 1447 and 1450. The statue was erected in 1453, and even before its public unveiling, the king of Naples wanted Donatello to execute a similar monument for him. In the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/equestrian-statue-of-gattamelata-at-padua][i]Equestrian statue of Gattamelata[/i][/url] (1453), Donatello weaved a series of symbols and references to classical antiquity, which showed the artist’s extensive knowledge and understanding of ancient art. In the mid-1450s, he returned to Florence. During this period, he undertook a commission for a bronze statue of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/donatello/statue-of-st-john-the-baptist-in-the-duomo-di-siena][i]Saint John the Baptist[/i][/url] (1457) for the Siena Cathedral. In his final years, Donatello worked for the Medici designing twin bronze pulpits for the San Lorenzo church. He died in 1466 in Florence, leaving the pulpits, his last work, unfinished. Eventually, the pulpits were completed by Donatello’s assistants, and are considered an important work of early Renaissance narrative sculpture.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi","relatedArtists":["57726d90edc2cb3880b4a580","57726df5edc2cb3880b5491f","5a3f9a06edc2c99894d84f72","5ba37028edc2c925b432e47c","5eb26bb0edc2c9c8f88b1f8a","5a3f9a06edc2c99894d84f72","57726d82edc2cb3880b48615","57726d86edc2cb3880b48fb3","57726dc6edc2cb3880b4ff99","57726d80edc2cb3880b48351","57726d7aedc2cb3880b4794d","57726d81edc2cb3880b483bc","5bc21fbbedc2c906086e2150","5d3861f1edc2c99ad04417b4","57726d87edc2cb3880b4941f","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa92","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a1e7","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a896","57726d89edc2cb3880b496ad","57726d7dedc2cb3880b47c88"]},{"id":"57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a241","artistName":"Joseph Wright","url":"joseph-wright","lastNameFirst":"Wright Joseph","birthDay":"/Date(-7426252800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-5438534400000)/","birthDayAsString":"September 3, 1734","deathDayAsString":"August 29, 1797","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/5a3c3f76-f39a-4f47-89fd-ed8733b710b3.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wright_of_Derby","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e8","57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce1","57726a66edc2ca38801d4ce9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Joseph Wright of Derby","relatedArtists":["5de1086eedc2c9ac20922659","57726da9edc2cb3880b4d051","57726dcbedc2cb3880b507aa","57726d7cedc2cb3880b47c54","57726d9aedc2cb3880b4b768","57726dd7edc2cb3880b51b56","589861b3edc2c970700322f6","57726e04edc2cb3880b5618a","57726d94edc2cb3880b4abbb","57726e04edc2cb3880b560c8","57726e04edc2cb3880b561a2","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a560","57726d9bedc2cb3880b4b9a9","57726d7fedc2cb3880b480ca","57726d80edc2cb3880b482a5","57726d8fedc2cb3880b4a4b6","58a30931edc2ccba145d3c52","5d35b55dedc2cbafe46d5b55","57726e00edc2cb3880b55b3d"]},{"id":"57726df0edc2cb3880b5411f","artistName":"Joseph Ducreux","url":"joseph-ducreux","lastNameFirst":"Ducreux Joseph","birthDay":"/Date(-7400678400000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-5283964800000)/","birthDayAsString":"June 26, 1735","deathDayAsString":"July 24, 1802","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/f4b2e847-fe92-45ac-9881-258c09cd5948.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ducreux","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6ee0","57726a66edc2ca38801d4cd9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Joseph Ducreux","relatedArtists":["57726da9edc2cb3880b4d051","57726dfeedc2cb3880b555e2","57726dfbedc2cb3880b5526a","57726d96edc2cb3880b4b0b8","57726dcbedc2cb3880b507aa","57726dd3edc2cb3880b51408","57726d7eedc2cb3880b47e9c","57726d9aedc2cb3880b4b768","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a93a","57726dfeedc2cb3880b55628","57726d91edc2cb3880b4a7df","57726d87edc2cb3880b4924d","57726dfeedc2cb3880b555b6","57726de6edc2cb3880b532db","57726dd3edc2cb3880b5144d","57726e02edc2cb3880b55ef3","57726de5edc2cb3880b5307b","57726dddedc2cb3880b525cf","57726d91edc2cb3880b4a78a","57726d8aedc2cb3880b499bd"]},{"id":"57aac1f6edc2c91b4c9b0796","artistName":"Joseph Farquharson","url":"joseph-farquharson","lastNameFirst":"Farquharson Joseph ","birthDay":"/Date(-3902428800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-1095552000000)/","birthDayAsString":"May 4, 1846","deathDayAsString":"April 15, 1935","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/joseph-farquharson.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Farquharson","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e8","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88","57726a66edc2ca38801d4cf1"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Joseph Farquharson","relatedArtists":["57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a125","57726d95edc2cb3880b4adeb","57726dbbedc2cb3880b4ed4b","57726df2edc2cb3880b544da","57726d88edc2cb3880b495db","57726d84edc2cb3880b48a43","57726d9aedc2cb3880b4b6e8","57726d8bedc2cb3880b49a98","58942e28edc2c965802fa84b","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b51d","57726dc9edc2cb3880b50473","57726ddbedc2cb3880b52139","57726dafedc2cb3880b4dac6","587ff0a5edc2c98c28608555","57726e06edc2cb3880b56478","5aea25a9edc2c9bcb4f31a82","588026aeedc2c98c2801a7f5","57726d92edc2cb3880b4a84e","57726dfeedc2cb3880b556bc","5a385ec9edc2c942b0648bd5"]},{"id":"5d1fb42cedc2c99e00235be8","artistName":"Francis A.

She continues the tradition of her author and artist great-grandmother, Queen Marie of Romania, and she inherited her love of photography from her father.\n\nShe recalls that he took a camera wherever he went on his travels, and that he had developed his own, beautiful, black and white photographs of the Carpathian Mountains, shot before the Communist takeover in 1947. From a very young age, Princess Sophie had her own and she vowed to become as sensitive a photographer as he.\n\nPrincess Sophie’s first exhibitions were in the late 1970s, in St. Tropez and Monte Carlo.\n\nAfter two and a half years’ study of Fine Arts and Photography in the United States, at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, she spent months in total isolation in Maine’s Acadia National Park, preparing a series of paintings of the rocky North Atlantic seacoast in acrylic on wood. These she exhibited on both American coasts, including Nantucket, Palm Beach, and Los Angeles. She also exhibited in Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nAfter extensive travel in the United States, she again picked up the thread of her studies at the Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington, DC. She intended to complete her Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design and earn a Master’s in Photography.\n\nHowever, the fall of Communism in Romania in December 1989, changed her life dramatically. She joined her father to support his and her family’s work in assisting the Romanian people in their struggle to recover their identity after decades of tyranny.\n\nAs vice president of the Princess Margareta of Romania Foundation, she traveled throughout Romania for the Foundation’s philanthropic work, distributing relief at first, then identifying potential projects. Princess Sophie then traveled to the four corners of the United States and to Canada to raise funds.\n\nThe proceeds of Princess Sophie’s first book, a collection of children&#39;s stories published in Bucharest in 1995, benefited the Foundation’s work for sick and disadvantaged children.\n\nShe picked up her camera again in 2000. Her first trip to Brittany, France, amazed her with its photographic possibilities. This area, on the European side of the North Atlantic, became her photographic playground. By 2007, Princess Sophie and her daughter were living there permanently.\n\nThe guidance of mentor Terence O’Donnell, a British artist and retired professional photographer specialized in war reportage settled in France, encouraged her to make photography her profession. She has since won recognition internationally as a photographic artist.\n\nPrincess Sophie uses her camera as a way to express herself, as a means to translate and convey the emotions she feels from any given scene. How various slants of light interact with the ocean, the coastal cliffs and rocks, the built environment of centuries- old churches, stone buildings, lighthouses — these particularly move the artist in her, as do the lush, ancient forests in which Brittany abounds.\n\nHer fervent defense of the natural and man-made environment has led her to become Honorary President, Ambassador, and an active member of “Phare en Cap,” which promotes and safeguards the Breton maritime heritage of the Cap Sizun, denominated a “Grand Site de France”, and the Pointe Du Millier in particular.\n\nPrincess Sophie, whose historic background is extensive, is also a member of the Center for the History of Brittany (Centre d’Histoire de Bretagne – Kreizenn Istor Breizh), which promotes the history of Brittany widely both within Brittany and beyond. She is currently contributing to its projected, searchable database of historical images of Brittany from the stone age through today.\n\nPrincess Sophie has also won several contests.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Sofia a României","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"57726d92edc2cb3880b4a896","artistName":"Andrea del Castagno","url":"andrea-del-castagno","lastNameFirst":"Castagno Andrea del","birthDay":"/Date(-17324755200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-16168809600000)/","birthDayAsString":"c.1421","deathDayAsString":"August 19, 1457","image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/andrea-del-castagno.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_del_Castagno","dictionaries":["57726a66edc2ca38801d4c99","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad6640","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d0"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"57726d92edc2cb3880b4a89a","title":"Famous men and women"}],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":" ","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Andrea di Bartolo di Bargilla","relatedArtists":["5d29b57cedc2c991d4992b21","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a1e7","5ab773c3edc2c9b7e03805b5","5d29b57cedc2c991d4992b21","57726d7cedc2cb3880b47b00","5b9cb574edc2c92278ab49dc","5eb26bb0edc2c9c8f88b1f8a","57726d7eedc2cb3880b47e74","57726d9bedc2cb3880b4b854","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa92","57726d93edc2cb3880b4aa0e","57726d87edc2cb3880b4941f","5d3861f1edc2c99ad04417b4","57726d81edc2cb3880b483bc","57726d7dedc2cb3880b47c88","57726d82edc2cb3880b48615","57726d8aedc2cb3880b49981","57726dceedc2cb3880b50c8f","57726dc7edc2cb3880b501e1"]},{"id":"5a3f9a06edc2c99894d84f72","artistName":"Lorenzo Ghiberti","url":"ghiberti","lastNameFirst":"Ghiberti Lorenzo","birthDay":"/Date(-18681667200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-16222982400000)/","birthDayAsString":"1378","deathDayAsString":"December 1, 1455","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00164/images//sin-t-tulo.png","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Ghiberti","dictionaries":["57726a66edc2ca38801d4c99","57726b4aedc2cb3880ad6640","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d0","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f00"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":1401,"activeYearsCompletion":1455,"biography":"Lorenzo Ghiberti ( 1378 – 1 December 1455), born Lorenzo di Bartolo, was a Florentine Italian artist of the Early Renaissance best known as the creator of the bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery, called by Michelangelo the Gates of Paradise.

Petrov-Vodkin was a Russian, later Soviet, painter and writer. He was first exposed to art as a child, when he took a few lessons from a local sign maker and icon painter. After secondary school, however, he wanted to join a railroad college, abandoning the artist life. He failed the entrance exams to the college, however, and instead began “Art Classes of Fedor Burov,” in his late teens. After the death of Burov two years later, Petrov-Vodkin took odd jobs painting in the city. Through his jobs and with his mother’s help, he was able to get an invitation to study in St. Petersburg, from 1895 to 1897. In art school, he later moved to Moscow and then Munich, graduating in1904. \r\n\r\nPetrov-Vodkin often entered in open conflict with the Russian-Orthodox Church, which considered his paintings too erotic, a conflict which was discussed by Alexandre Benois, a proponent of Petrov-Vodkin’s works, and Ilya Repin, a detractor. His use of Russian religious iconography was also deemed blasphemous, and at one point the church, disapproving of the artist’s work on a chapel in Samara, destroyed his paintings. His paintings were often centered on what he considered his “spherical perspective,” which made the viewer aware of the curve of the globe. He was also an accomplished violinist. \r\n\r\nAfter contracting pulmonary tuberculosis in 1927, Petrov-Vodkin was forced to quit painting. He thusly turned to writing, completing a number of works, including three semi-autobiographical novels, the first two of which are considered some of the finest Russian literature of the time. The soviet government, which was a supporter of Petrov-Vodkin’s works, disallowed the organization of any but state authorized artistic groups in 1932. One of these state supported groups was the Leningrad Union of Artists, of which Petrov-Vodkin was elected the first president in 1932.\r\n\r\nPetrov-Vodkin’s works were largely ignored after his death of tuberculosis, until the mid-1960’s when there came a renewed interest in both his artistic and literary works. His three self-illustrated and semi-autobiographical books were republished in the 1970’s and much acclaimed.

Bacciarelli was a Polish-Italian painter of the late-baroque and Neoclassic periods. Although born and bred in Italy, Bacciarelli spent most of his life in Poland, working for King Stanisław August Poniatowski. The Polish monarch was very ambitious and demanding. He had an extensive knowledge of art, enjoyed discussions and meddled in the artist’s work, giving him advice and correcting his sketches. Bacciarelli had a difficult job, yet he was able to meet the king’s expectations. He quickly won the trust and true friendship of Stanisław August Poniatowski. Having become the royal court painter in 1764, Bacciarelli was entrusted with all important artistic tasks, including the foundation of the first Polish painting school, called Malarnia. The artist also decorated the interiors of the royal palaces and was responsible for creating a gallery of paintings. Following the king’s order, Bacciarelli went on a trip to his native Italy to keep up with the latest trends in art and get in touch with other artists; however, he came back to Warsaw, where he and his family settled permanently. After the king had left the capital, the artist continued to take care of his collections, informing the monarch in detail about the progress of his works in many letters. \nBacciarelli usually painted portraits and history works illustrating the history of Poland. He produced many series of paintings decorating, for example, the Royal Castle in Warsaw. Their aim was to show the glory of the country as well as exemplary Polish citizens.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Marcello

Harris was born in a family recently made wealthy through the invention and production of farm machinery: this circumstance created lifelong material security for the artist. His family was strongly religious, so he inherited a commitment to spiritual truth. Since Harris was a child, he showed an interest in drawing. His artistic talent was noticed and encouraged by his parents. At 19, in 1904, he went to Berlin where he privately studied art for three years. His training was academic, focusing on the problem of composition, light, construction of volumes, perspective, as his first sketches of the Berlin streets shown.\n \nUrban scenes that he learned to look at in Berlin were the first subject of his art: his first major oil painting was, in fact, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lawren-harris/a-row-of-houses-wellington-street-street-painting-i-1910][i]Wellington Street[/i][/url] (1910).  Although the painting may seem a simple everyday city scene, we can see in it the seeds of what will be the great interest of Harris: nature, captured in the curved line of the trees and the snow on the branches simplified in spots of color. Harris balanced his interest in city scenes with that of Canadian wilderness and landscapes, often painting in Canadian forests.\n\nIn 1908, Harris became part of the Toronto Arts and Letters Club. Canadian artists were searching for an authentic way to express their experience of their land. Gradually, the painters began to work together, touring Canada to study and paint landscapes. In 1913, Harris traveled to Buffalo to visit an exhibition of Scandinavian artists. It was like a revelation: in those artists, the vigor of the landscapes had incorporated the decorative manner of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/art-nouveau]Art Nouveau[/url]. Thus, the landscapes of Harris changed: large color patterns began to appear in his works, the color became flatter but no less alive, the brushstrokes more evident and ribbon-like, as we can see in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lawren-harris/winter-sunrise-1913][i]Winter sunrise[/i][/url] (1913).  \n\nIn early 1914 Harris and other Canadian painters, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/j-e-h-macdonald]J. MacDonald[/url] and Tom Thompson started to travel and to work together. They founded the Studio Building, a meeting and working point which enabled the artists to feel like members of a community. They enrolled in the troops fighting in World War I in 1916. Harris was never sent out of Ontario, but he went through two tragedies. In 1917 his brother Howard died overseas, and then Thompson drowned or was murdered during a boat excursion on Canoe Lake. These events brought Harris to a mental breakdown.\n\nIn May 1918 he was advised by his doctor to move to the Algoma region to find peace and mental rest. Soon, Harris fell in love with nature and wrote: \"[i]There was a wild richness and clarity of colors in the woods. I became conscious that the spirit of the land has to be discovered through its character.[/i]\" The sense of artistic mission was reborn. He restarted work and travel in the wilderness. The sketches that Harris produced in that season caught the eye of Sir Edmund Walker, a financier, and patron who was also president of the [i]Art Gallery of Toronto[/i]. Walker exposed some of Harris artworks at the gallery in 1919. In May 1920, Harris and his friends again exhibited at the gallery: the Group of Seven was born. \n\nThe more Harris worked in the North, the more direct, forceful, and original his relationship with nature became. He painted the Algoma country from 1919 to 1921, and his technique evolved: trees became bare columns, remote forests turned into simplified masses, the light became more spiritual. In the autumn of 1921, Harris and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/a-y-jackson]A.Y. Jackson[/url] decided to travel westwards. Harris was awestruck, discovering Lake Superior Country. [i]\"I have never seen anything so impressive. That smooth glimmering infinity of waters was like a glimpse of God himself.[/i]\" Harris found an elemental landscape, to which his spirit could respond almost entirely. His [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lawren-harris/pic-island-lake-superior-1924][i]Pic Island[/i][/url] (1924) is a perfect example of his formal terms, where he would express his profound spiritual vision –  an austere landscape, in which the natural world has been transformed into a symbol.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Harris increased his tendency to reduce forms to their essence: mountains, water, islands, forests, and trees became more and more idealized, and the human presence disappeared entirely from his paintings. Harris was also an adherent of theosophy, a movement representing a unique blend of Oriental and Western mysticism. Since his first exposure to theosophy, Harris had been attracted by the theosophy's message of \"oneness\": the necessary interdependence of all things. For theosophists, the only spirit was present in the universe: a life essence manifested in the light of the Sun. This influenced his art. He was convinced that \"[i]art is a realm of life between our mundane world and the world of the spirit, between the infinite diversity of manifested life and the unity or harmony of the spirit, or between the temporal world and the realm of enduring and incorruptible ideation.[/i]\"\n\nHarris translated these ideas into the use of colors: the color blue carried spiritual power, and the white color communicated enlightenment. Harris's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franklin-carmichael/north-shore-lake-superior-1927][i]North Shore, Lake Superior[/i][/url] (1926-1927) is the work that best embodies this philosophy.\n\nThe artist had a new inspiration during a trip into western Canada, which began in 1924. His painting became colder, and the form of the subject even more austere than before: mountains became symbolic hands, turned in prayer towards Heaven, struck by light. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lawren-harris/isolation-peak-rocky-mountains-1930][i]Isolation Peak[/i][/url] (1930) represents a late climax in Harris's struggle to translate his religious ideas into the paint. \n\nThe subsequent artistic production of Harris was focused on the top of the world: the Arctic. In 1930, Harris and Jackson sailed to Baffin Island. The icebergs were the last revelation of nature for Harris: they were transfigured into austere and powerful monuments. The painter pushed his landscape's study to the limit. He was 45 years old, and he faced a moment of truth. In a letter written to a friend, he sensed the ending of an era: \"[i]I feel as if my painting days are over. I'm at a crossroads, and I have no vision to know what to do, what road to take.[/i]\"\n\nIn the second half of the 1930s, Harris entered an exciting new phase in his career, when he began painting abstract pictures, composed of severe geometric forms, which initially derived from his Rocky Mountain and Arctic canvases. Those abstractions were among the first in Canadian art. Harris settled in Vancouver in 1940 and continued to paint until his death in 1970.\n\n[u]By Maddalena Mongera[/u]","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Lawren Stewart Harris","relatedArtists":["57726dc8edc2cb3880b50274","57726d8eedc2cb3880b4a159","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f450","57726d89edc2cb3880b4971d","5a4cf1f1edc2c900bce1832d","598362fcedc2c9658c38ed9e","57726df8edc2cb3880b54eae","57726e06edc2cb3880b5639d","57726d94edc2cb3880b4aba1","57726da9edc2cb3880b4d161","57726dc8edc2cb3880b50373","57726da8edc2cb3880b4cfd9","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c408","57726da8edc2cb3880b4cfc1","57726dc8edc2cb3880b50274","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f47c","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4bb96","57726dc1edc2cb3880b4f87c","57726ddfedc2cb3880b52866"]},{"id":"57726dc8edc2cb3880b50274","artistName":"Emily Carr","url":"emily-carr","lastNameFirst":"Carr Emily","birthDay":"/Date(-3094243200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-783734400000)/","birthDayAsString":"December 13, 1871","deathDayAsString":"March 2, 1945","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/temp/57e2e2d4-39a2-45ac-9acd-ba6b9cc5ce5f.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Carr","dictionaries":["57726b4bedc2cb3880ad6930","57726b50edc2cb3880ad72c0","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88","57726a67edc2ca38801d4dd1","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d31","5b581f12edc2c918c860b7b9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Emily Carr is considered to be a major Canadian artist for her depiction of the landscapes of Pacific Northwest and its aboriginal culture. Being one of the pioneers of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/modernism#!#resultType:masonry]Modernist[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism#!#resultType:masonry]Post-Impressionist[/url] styles of painting in Canada, she was not recognized until late in her life.\n\nCarr was born in Victoria, British Columbia in 1871. Her inclination to art was duly encouraged by her father, Richard Carr, a wholesale merchant. After the death of both her parents in 1890, she started to pursue art seriously, and studied at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/san-francisco-art-institute-sfai-san-francisco-ca#!#resultType:masonry]San Francisco Art Institute[/url] for two years. At the age of 26, Carr visited a small village near Ucluelet located on the western coast of the Vancouver Island. There she sketched the lives of the Nootka people, indigenous to the land. Her interest in the lifestyle of Indian people was promoted by her trip to Alaska, where she spent days sketching the daily activities of the villagers.\n\nIn 1899, Carr went to the UK to study at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/westminster-school-of-art-london-uk#!#resultType:masonry]Westminster School of Art[/url] in London. In England she befriended and worked with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albert-julius-olsson]Julius Olsson[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/algernon-talmage]Algernon Talmage[/url], artists of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/st-ives-school#!#resultType:masonry]St. Ives School[/url]. By the time she returned to Canada, Carr established herself as a professional artist. She worked as a teacher at the Ladies Art Club in Vancouver, where she was highly unpopular among the students due to her smoking habits and cursing, that eventually led her to resign from her job. \n\nAfter her tryst with many Indian villages in the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Upper Skeena River, Carr once again went to Europe in 1910, to study at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/acad-mie-colarossi#!#resultType:masonry]Académie Colarossi[/url] in Paris. She also took private lessons from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/harry-phelan-gibb]Harry Phelan Gibb[/url] who influenced her palette adding there more vibrant colors. She was also influenced by French Post-Impressionism and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism#!#resultType:masonry]Fauvism[/url], and, after returning back to Canada in 1912, she exhibited 70 oils and watercolors of her “french period”, showing those influences. However, her bold new style was not appreciated by Canadians.  \n\nDuring the next 15 years, Carr did not paint much. She run a boarding house, took a short-story writing course, and spent some time in San Francisco doing different jobs, like painting decorations for the St. Francis Hotel and drawing cartoons for Western Woman’s Weekly. In 1927 Carr attended an exhibition of West Coast Aboriginal art in National Gallery of Canada. There she met [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lawren-harris]Lawren Harris[/url] and other members of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/group-of-seven#!#resultType:masonry]Group of Seven[/url], the most recognized modern painters in Canada at that time. Their distinctively Canadian art impressed her greatly, and triggered the most prolific period of her creative career. Throughout the decade, she mastered the scenes from the daily lives, traditions and culture of the indigenous Americans. With Lawren Harris as her mentor, Carr began to paint bold, almost hallucinatory canvases with which many people identify her - paintings of Aboriginal totem poles set in deep forest locations or the sites of abandoned Indigenous villages. \n\nAfter a year or two Carr left Aboriginal subjects to devote herself to nature themes. From 1928 on, critical recognition and exposure in exhibitions of more than regional significance, like the National Gallery of Canada and the American Federation of Artists in Washington, D.C., began to come her way. There was even the occasional sale, though never enough to improve her financial situation. In full mastery of her talents and with deepening vision, she continued to produce a great body of paintings freely expressive of the large rhythms of Western forests, driftwood-tossed beaches and expansive skies, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emily-carr/indian-church-1929][i]Indian Church[/i][/url] (1929), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emily-carr/loggers-culls-1935][i]Loggers’ Culls[/i][/url] (1935), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emily-carr/heart-of-the-forest-1935][i]Heart of the Forest[/i][/url] (1935). \n\nIn 1937, Carr suffered her first heart attack, which marked the beginning of a decline in her health and a lessening of the energy required for painting. Artworks from her last decade, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emily-carr/odds-and-ends-1939][i]Odds and Ends[/i][/url] (1939), reveal her growing anxiety about the environmental impact of industry on British Columbia's landscape and on the lives of Indigenous people. Carr died in 1945 of a heart attack. More than half a century after her death, she has become a Canadian icon. Her long preoccupation with the Indigenous culture of the Canadian west coast coincided with the beginnings of a rising tide of awareness and confident self-identification on the part of Aboriginal people who had for some time been considered part of a moribund culture. In the same way, her passionate involvement with nature and its portrayal coincided with a growing popular awareness of environmental issues and an accompanying sense of loss associated with the disappearance of \"nature\" in our own day. And the fact that she was a woman fighting the overwhelming obstacles that faced women of her day to become an artist of stunning originality and strength has made her a favorite of the women's movement.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Emily

Kiandjan's work brings a new singular way of making op art, mixing 20th Century rules and current techniques.\n\nHis main and absolutely innovative signature consists in stereosymmetry. It means that his structures all have symmetrical axes or centers even though colors aren't symmetrical. That discrepancy between colors and shapes fosters the vertigo and/or emotion into the eyes of watchers, and fits this way with the artistic line of the historic 1965's Responsive Eye exhibition at MoMA in NYC that made op art become such a major movement.\n\nKiandjan found an interest in art very soon when he was able to sketch both color gradients and geometric shapes. Much of his career is committed to painting, engraving and creating lithographs. He showed growing interest in artistic avant-garde movement in America : Ivan Serpa, Jesús-Rafael Soto, Barbara Kasten, Frank Stella, Carlos Cruz-Diez, and Edna Andrade. He was also influenced by Bauhaus movement, El Lissitzky, František Kupka, and László Moholy-Nagy. In his works, the progression of forms with slight variations create illusions of rhythmic movements when completed. In his Paris studio, Kiandjan mixes colors and light to give birth to abstract and geometric representations. His work consists of building complex constructions in the assembly of simple patterns. It reveals an innovative use of gradients and breaks in shapes in the act of depicting a three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["57726df1edc2cb3880b543ec","5841c46eedc2c99dd0aed151","57726deaedc2cb3880b5383d","59f37886edc2c9ac907e3b7c","5b745aebedc2c91e28dcf5a7","57726de4edc2cb3880b52ef6","57726df0edc2cb3880b5422b","57726de3edc2cb3880b52e14","57726de2edc2cb3880b52cc5","57726ddeedc2cb3880b5273f","57726db6edc2cb3880b4e614","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f276","57726ddcedc2cb3880b5240f","57726de9edc2cb3880b53673","57726df6edc2cb3880b54ab8","57726dc2edc2cb3880b4f91e","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c633","57726dc7edc2cb3880b50062","57726dd7edc2cb3880b51a9e","57726da2edc2cb3880b4c510"]},{"id":"5d41e278edc2c9198407f21c","artistName":"Mihnea Cernat","url":"mihnea-cernat","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(656467200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"October 21, 1990","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00247/images//dsc-0628.JPG!Portrait.JPG","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":["57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6e88","57726a68edc2ca38801d4ff9","57726a67edc2ca38801d4f31","57726b50edc2cb3880ad72a0","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f20"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["58325e76edc2c968f8ac20b0","59fa3025edc2c976586d4413","582221f9edc2cb69a0d6ad3a","5a85023bedc2c9584c46dc78","57fb80e8edc2c95dd085c44c","5b35e592edc2c92434f9d709","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cd3d","57726da7edc2cb3880b4cd27","57726de8edc2cb3880b53578","58e5865eedc2c98c788f5455","57726da1edc2cb3880b4c4a0","57726dddedc2cb3880b52519","5978a7f0edc2cca318304b59","5a34fdb2edc2c9cae090015a","57726db2edc2cb3880b4e025","57726e06edc2cb3880b5640f","59fb5cccedc2c9ab282c1139","57726dd9edc2cb3880b51d6c","57726d97edc2cb3880b4b23d","57726e01edc2cb3880b55c56"]},{"id":"5d44c063edc2c9acc89fe9b7","artistName":"Stanisław Szukalski","url":"stanislaw-szukalski","lastNameFirst":"Szukalski Stanisław","birthDay":"/Date(-2399932800000)/","deathDay":"/Date(548380800000)/","birthDayAsString":"December 13, 1893","deathDayAsString":"May 19, 1987","image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00248/images//szu.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szukalski","dictionaries":["57726b4dedc2cb3880ad6de8","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4e29","57726b50edc2cb3880ad7260","57726b4eedc2cb3880ad6f00"],"periods":[],"series":[{"id":"5d4865d7edc2c94008100000","title":"Zermatism"}],"activeYearsStart":1910,"activeYearsCompletion":1987,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Stanisław Szukalski","relatedArtists":["57726d9eedc2cb3880b4bdcb","57726d8cedc2cb3880b49e7e","5c9ffbb6edc2c925107b8347","57726d9cedc2cb3880b4ba1f","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b4e9","57726dbeedc2cb3880b4f2b9","57726d82edc2cb3880b48728","57726e06edc2cb3880b56517","5784bfadedc2cb202cf438f1","57726dfdedc2cb3880b554b9","57726dcbedc2cb3880b50737","57726dfcedc2cb3880b55306","57726d85edc2cb3880b48d99","57726dcbedc2cb3880b50727","57726d7aedc2cb3880b478db","5a437541edc2c968200b7f3a"]},{"id":"5ebadd44edc2c9894ce3fc68","artistName":"SCOTT ZUCKERMAN","url":"scott-zuckerman","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(-599616000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1951","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads.wikiart.org/Content/images/ARTIST-480x600.jpg","wikipediaUrl":null,"dictionaries":[],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Connecticut artist, [url href=https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/scott_zuckerman_pheasant.html]Scott Zuckerman[/url] studied at the Pratt Institute of Art (Brooklyn, NYC) and the Art Students League (Manhattan, NYC).

Weir was mentored by New York portraitist, John Jarvis and took study with Robert Cooke, an English heraldic artist. In 1824 he traveled to Florence, Italy where he studied the Renaissance Masters and took study with Italian neoclassical painter, Pietro Benvenuti, then onto Rome where he resided with the American neoclassical artist, Horatio Greenough. 1827 saw his return New York City where he opened his artist’s studio and was elected to the National Academy of Design in 1829. In 1834, he became the Professor of Drawing at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, on the recommendation of poet and editor of the New York Evening Post, William Cullen Bryant; a position he held for 42 years. His pupils included Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E Lee, George Derby, and James Whistler as well as his own sons, John Ferguson and Julian Alden Weir, themselves artists. His 1836 mural, Peace and War, was installed in the West Point chapel, and in 1843, his Peace and War, and his Embarkation of the Pilgrims from Delft Haven, in Holland was installed in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol Building. Although not generally associated with the Hudson River School of artists, Weir painted scenes of the Hudson River valley and his handling of light is reminiscent of the style of the Hudson River School.

He received his formal training at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/national-gallery-of-victoria-art-school-melbourne]National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne[/url]. In 1938, the collectors John and Sunday Reed became patrons of his work, and, through them, he became a member of the influential avant-garde Melbourne [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/heide-circle]Heide Circle[/url], with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albert-tucker]Albert Tucker[/url], John Perceval and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joy-hester]Joy Hester[/url]. While serving in the army from 1942 to 1945, he began to paint the desert landscapes of the Australian Outback in a painterly-realist style. In 1949 he traveled with his second wife Cynthia and her daughter Jinx to Central Australia, documenting the savage effects of the drought on the rural landscape. In addition to landscapes, Nolan often focused on Australian history, depicting legendary characters, particularly the Robin Hood-like outlaw Ned Kelly. \n\nIn 1955, Nolan moved to London, but his interest in portraying the Australian landscapes persisted. In London, he was involved with the theater and designed stage sets for a production of Igor Stravinsky’s ballet [i]The Rite of Spring[/i]. He was knighted in 1981 and awarded the Order of Merit in 1983.  The artist died on November 28, 1992 in London, United Kingdom Today, Nolan’s works are in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra, the Tate Gallery in London, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.\n\nNolan’s style is characterized by its fluid paint handling atop slick surfaces like Masonite and glass. He was influenced by European art, especially by  Picasso, Paul Klee, Henri Matisse, and the surrealists.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Sir Sidney Robert Nolan OM,

Georg Baselitz was enormously influential in showing a generation of German artists how they might come to terms with issues of art and national identity in the wake of the Second World War. Briefly trained in the officially sanctioned social realism of Communist East Berlin, he soon moved to West Berlin, and encountered abstract art. Ultimately, however, he was to reject both options. While others turned to Conceptual art, Pop, and Arte Povera, Baselitz revived the German Expressionism that had been denounced by the Nazis, and returned the human figure to a central position in painting. Controversial when he first emerged in 1963, and controversial again nearly two decades later when he began to produce sculpture, Baselitz inspired a revival of Neo-Expressionist painting in Germany in the 1970s, and his example gave encouragement to many more who took up similar styles both in Europe and the United States in the 1980s.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Hans-Georg

At the same time, Schnabel also became an accomplished film director: [i]Before the Night Falls[/i] (2000) won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival, and [i]The Diving Bell[/i] and [i]The Butterfly[/i] (2006) was nominated for four Academy Awards. Even though the success of his movies at times overshadowed his accomplishments as a painter, the artist remains prolific and sees himself as a painter first and foremost.\n\nSchnabel was born on October 26, 1951, in Brooklyn, New York, and in 1965 he moved with his parents to Brownsville, Texas. He received a BFA from the University of Houston and afterward participated in the Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Subsequently, he traveled to Europe, which had a profound impact on his aesthetics and artistic style. For example, his visit to Barcelona and the architecture of Antonio Gaudí inspired broken plate paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/the-student-of-prague-1983][i]The Student of Prague[/i][/url] (1983). In the painting, Schnabel also channeled Christian ritual imagery by layering crucifixes over broken dishes and choosing a triptych structure typical of altar paintings. Religious motifs are recurring in Schnabel’s paintings partly because of his interest in art history, and his tendency to integrate different sources of inspiration into a single artwork. \n\nFrom 1987, Schnabel began using written words in his art and made them the central motif of his paintings. The word selection was spontaneous and random, like in the series of paintings executed on felucca sails, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/jane-birkin-1990][i]Jane Birkin[/i][/url] (1990) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/jane-birkin-2-1990][i]Jane Birkin #2[/i][/url] (1990). The artist bought the sails during a 1988 trip to Egypt, and because the boat was named Jane, he decided to make the actress and singer Jane Birkin the subject of the series. The use of the written word displays his affinity for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]Abstract Expressionism[/url], especially for the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/cy-twombly]Cy Twombly[/url], who often used words as a kind of gesture in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/cy-twombly/pan][i]Pan[/i][/url] (1975).\n\nDuring the 1990s, Schnabel completed his first feature film, [i]Basquiat[/i] (1996) - a semi-biographical account of the life of fellow Neo-Expressionist and late friend [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-michel-basquiat]Jean-Michel Basquiat[/url]. The movie also depicts the New York art scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the environment in which Basquiat and Schnabel found success. In [i]Basquiat[/i], Schnabel addressed the idea of the artist as a tortured genius. Although Schnabel himself does not fit this mold, he cultivated a public persona of a bohemian artist. This attitude and outspokenness make Schnabel a controversial figure in the art world; he is adored by some and harshly criticized by others. In more recent works, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/basic-boating-2015-2015][i]Basic Boating[/i][/url] (2015), Schnabel used photographic imagery as the basis of the painting to which he added bold gestural strokes. \n\nSchnabel's artworks responded to the dry intellectualism and non-objectivity of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/minimalism]Minimalist[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/conceptual-art]Conceptual[/url] movements, which to him were antithetical to the powerful emotional expressionism of his own painting.

From painting to photography and film to installations and prints, Polke's work, which often incorporated non-traditional materials and techniques, was above all a critique of art itself. \n\nIn 1961, Polke enrolled at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/kunstakademie-dusseldorf-dusseldorf-germany#!#resultType:masonry]Düsseldorf Arts Academy[/url], where he studied until 1967. Teachers at the school included [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/karl-otto-gotz]Karl Otto Gotz[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joseph-beuys]Joseph Beuys[/url], both of whom had radical approaches that would strongly influence Polke. \n\nDuring the postwar years, Polke began making his \"dot\" paintings, manually executed parodies of the dot screens used by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein]Roy Lichtenstein[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol]Andy Warhol[/url]. The example of such paintings is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/bunnies-1966][i]Bunnies[/i][/url] (1966). Although Polke shared visual strategies with American [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop artists[/url], he was not so much appropriating the visual style of advertising as depicting objects of a consumer society. While at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1963, Polke and fellow students [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/konrad-lueg]Konrad Lueg[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter]Gerhard Richter[/url] consolidated their ideas within a group they called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/capitalist-realism]Capitalist Realism[/url]. The humorous and deliberately \"unskilled\" qualities of Polke's earliest works formalized a critique of both [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/socialist-realism]Socialist Realism[/url] and Pop art.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Polke slowed his art production in favor of travel to Afghanistan, Brazil, France, Pakistan, and the U.S. There he shot photographs and film footage that he would use in his subsequent works during the 1980s. Incorporating materials such as sheer synthetic fabrics, colored lacquers, and hydrosensitive chemicals in combination with paint, he undermined the conventions of painting. He challenged its appropriateness as a medium to comment on contemporary life. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/kathereiner-s-morning-wood-kathreiners-morgenlatte-1979][i]Kathreiners Morgenlatte[/i][/url] (1969-1979), with its layered composition of the fabric and painted imagery, is an example of this questioning. By reconciling a complex group of references in [i]Kathreiners Morgenlatte[/i], Polke presents a critique of the condition of the artist and the impossibility of sustained originality in contemporary art in the late 20th century. \n\nIn 1977, Polke was given a position as a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Hamburg, Germany, and remained in the post until 1991. He moved permanently to Cologne in 1978, where he lived and worked for the remainder of his life, aside from his travels. In the 1980s, Polke's art took on a more serious tone. At the beginning of the decade, he traveled to Australia and Southeast Asia, where he discovered a variety of non-traditional materials that he used in his artworks. For instance, Polke began incorporating meteor dust and arsenic, which reacted chemically on the canvas.\n\nThe 1980s saw a significant international revival of painting as a medium and Polke was at the forefront of this, along with his former collaborator, Gerhard Richter. He continued to produce art until his death in 2010, often in collaboration with his wife, and always experimenting with new materials and media, including photocopies and holograms.\n\nAt the fore of Polke's experiments was the impulse to challenge virtually every convention of art, often in surprising and ingenious ways. His iconoclastic tendencies extended not merely to content but to the materials of the works themselves, which were often adamantly non-traditional. From uranium and meteorite dust, brightly printed fabric and soot, to bubble wrap and potatoes, Polke's artistic odyssey took him and his work to the potential limits of creation. Polke's unorthodox style proved a significant influence on a large group of younger artists. Most of them came to prominence in the 1980s when Polke was at the height of his fame and had been featured in several high-profile international exhibitions. Among the younger generation of artists who cite Polke as inspiration are sculptor Annette Messager, and multimedia artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss. Later, Polke's critical role in reviving painting practices influenced painters such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-salle]David Salle[/url], [url

Herni was both as an artist in his own right and a teacher of greats such as Edward Hopper, George Bellows, Rockwell Kent and Stuart Davis.  He started to gain a following in the 1890s, during his time in Philidelphia, where he met four illustrators for the Philidelphia Press: George Luks, Everitt Shinn, John French Sloan and William Glackens, colloquially known as the \"Philidelphia Four.\"  These men would meet at Henri's apartment to discuss art, philosophy, culture and more, their meetings became known as the Charcoal Club because the also did drawings from life.  Over several years, he split his time between Philidelphia and Paris and was exposed to spontaneous depictions of life that would ultimately inspire his mature style.  The Philidelphia Four would have been used to depicting real-life scenes quickly so he gained influence from them and while in Paris he met Canadian artist, James Wilson Morrice, who introduced him to a technique of painting quickly on small boards of wood that could be stored in the pocket, along with a small artist's kit.  This gave Henri the chance to practice his style on the go, by 1895 he had completely reconsidered Impressionism calling it \"new academism.\"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"Robert Henry

He played an important role in the development of Flemish art in the first half of the 17th century through his innovations in many genres including genre painting and his introduction of new subject matter.

early 20th Century artist and illustrator in the Art Nouveau tradition.\n    She was born in Chicago in 1900. Very introverted as a child, she preferred drawing to social interaction with her peers. When her father died, she moved with her family to Missouri where she won several awards in the Kansas State Fair (c. 1913).\n    Sterrett returned to Chicago with her family in 1915 where she entered high school with intentions of persuing a career in art which she continued into the Chicago Institute of Art. However, a decline in her mother's health forced her to drop out so that she could support her family working at several ad agencies.\n    1919 brought Sterrett her first commission--Comtesse du Ségur's [i]Old French Fairytales[/i]--and the first signs of the tuberculosis that would follow her for the remainder of her life. She recieved $750 (around $11,000 in 2018) for eight watercolors, sixteen pen and ink drawings, a color cover, and various drawn accents for the end papers and boards. She was immediately hired to illustrate Nathaniel Hawkthorne's [i]Tanglewood Tales[/i] on similar terms which would be published in 1921.\n    Plagued by failing health, Sterrett moved once more with her family to Altadena, California hoping that the warmer climate would give some improvement to her condition. However, her health continued to worsten and she was moved to a Sanitorium wherein she completed her work on [i]The Arabian Nights[/i] over three years.\n    For a brief period at the end of the 20s, her health improved an she was able to leave the Sanitorium and display her work in several local galleries and competitions, but it didn't last and with a sudden worstening of her condition she died on June 8, 1931 at the age of 30 leaving her final commission for [i]Myths and Legends[/i] incomplete.","gender":"female","originalArtistName":"Virginia Frances

Brike nasceu no ano de 1980, em Riga, na Letónia, um pequeno país do nordeste da Europa, que era naquele tempo sob ocupação soviética.\n\nEla estudou pintura acadêmica na Academia de Arte da Letónia e recebeu mestrado em 2005.\n\nEla já expôs seu trabalho internacionalmente em locais profissionais desde 1996, quando era adolescente, teve 11 exposições individuais e cerca de 100 outros projetos e exposições em todo o mundo.\n\nSeu principal interesse é a arte visual com uma narrativa forte e representação de uma figura, principalmente usando o meio tradicional de pintura a óleo sobre tela, mas também tiragem, animação, escultura de mídia mista, instalação e arte digital.\n\n\nSuas inspirações para o trabalho tem sido tão diversos como: contos de fadas, folclore, ilustrações de livros infantis, filmes de animação soviéticos, e pintura clássica sobrenaturalmente realista; o colorido proibido era um segredo raro da cultura pop ocidental cercada pelo tom místico e quase religioso para as crianças soviéticas; as histórias de guerra e de deportação terríveis que seus avós e seus irmãos testemunharam quando crianças pequenas; sua arte trás uma atmosfera sinistra sobre cerimônias da Igreja Católica no campo da Letónia, e as incrivelmente belas performances de ballet na ópera, onde ela foi levada desde os dois anos de idade.\n\nO foco principal da arte de Jana Brike é o espaço interno e estado de uma alma humana – sonhos, desejo, amor, dor, e auto-descoberta.\n\nTexto integral retirado de:

Morris is best known as the 19th century's most celebrated designer, but he was also a driven polymath who spent much of his life fighting the consensus. A key figure in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/arts-and-crafts#!#resultType:masonry]Arts & Crafts Movement[/url], Morris championed a principle of handmade production that didn't chime with the Victorian era's focus on industrial 'progress.' \n\nMorris was born in Walthamstow, east London, in 1834. The financial success of his broker father gave Morris a privileged childhood in Woodford Hall (a country house in Essex), as well as an inheritance large enough to mean he would never need to earn an income. Time spent exploring local parkland, forest, and churches, and an enthusiasm for the stories of Walter Scott, helped Morris develop an early affinity with landscape, buildings and historical romance. He also had precociously strong opinions on design. On a family trip to London in 1851, Morris (aged 16) demonstrated his loyalty to craft principles by refusing to enter the Great Exhibition – which championed Machine Age design – on the grounds of taste.\n\nAfter school, Morris went to Oxford University to study for the Church. It was there that he met [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-burne-jones]Edward Burne-Jones[/url], who was to become one of the era's most famous painters, and Morris's life-long friend. Burne-Jones introduced him to a group of students who became known as 'The Set' or '[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood]The Brotherhood[/url]' and who enjoyed romantic stories of medieval chivalry and self-sacrifice. They also read books by contemporary reformers such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-ruskin]John Ruskin[/url], Charles Kingsley, and Thomas Carlyle. Belonging to this group gave Morris an awareness of the deep divisions in modern society. It sparked his interest in trying to create an alternative to the dehumanizing industrial systems that produced poor-quality, 'unnatural' objects.\n\nIn 1855, Morris and Burne-Jones went on an architectural tour of northern France that made both men realize that they were more committed to art than the Church. Soon after, Morris began work in the office of George Edmund Street, the era's leading Neo-Gothic architect. Morris showed little talent for architecture and spent most of his time setting up Oxford and Cambridge Magazine, a vehicle both for his writing and that of other members of The Brotherhood. Morris left Street's office after only eight months, to begin a career as an artist. Burne-Jones's connection with the artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti]Dante Gabriel Rossetti[/url] – a central figure in the Pre-Raphaelite group – soon led to Morris working with Rossetti as part of a team painting murals at the Oxford Union.\n\nWhile working in Oxford, Morris had a chance meeting with a local stableman's daughter, Jane Burden. Consciously flouting the rules of class, Morris married Jane in 1859 (and her striking looks were to make her a model of idealized beauty for members of the Pre-Raphaelite group for the next 30 years). Morris commissioned architect Philip Webb – whom he had met during his time at Street's – to design and build a home for himself and his wife in rural Kent. In part, Morris wanted to realize the idea of a craft-based artistic community that he and Burne-Jones had been talking about since they were students. The result was Red House, a property that would be 'medieval in spirit' and, eventually, able to accommodate more than one family.\n\nMorris and Jane moved into Red House in 1860 and, unhappy with what was on offer commercially, spent the next two years furnishing and decorating the interior with help from members of their artistic circle. Huge murals and hand-embroidered fabrics decorated the walls, creating the feel of a historic manor house. Prompted by the success of their efforts (and the experience of 'joy in collective labor'), Morris and his friends decided in 1861 to set up their own interiors company: Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. Everything was to be created by hand, a principle that set the company firmly against the mainstream focus on industrialized 'progress.'\n\nInitially, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. specialized in the kind of wall paintings and embroidered hangings that had been produced for Red House. Although in its first few years the company didn't make much money, it did win a series of commissions to decorate newly built churches and became well known for work in stained glass. Morris had always wanted the firm to be based at Red House, but the practical restrictions of a small, rural workshop (as well as the death of Burne-Jones's young son) meant that the idea of a medieval-style craft-based community was abandoned. Morris sold Red House in 1865, and the family moved back to London.\n\nIn the late 1860s, two prestigious decorating commissions helped establish Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.'s reputation: one for a new dining room at the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A), and another at St James's Palace. During this period, Morris was also working on [i]The Earthly Paradise[/i], an epic poem with an anti-industrial message that established Morris as one of the foremost poets of his day. He was also busy producing his first wallpapers, whose designs were inspired by English gardens and hedgerows. To make them, he researched and revived historical printing and dyeing methods. This insistence on establishing a 'from scratch' understanding of the process was to become a hallmark of Morris's career.\n\nIn 1875 Morris became the sole director of the renamed and restructured Morris & Company. Over the next decade, he continued to design at an impressive rate, adding at least 32 printed fabrics, 23 woven fabrics, and 21 wallpapers – as well as more designs for carpets and rugs, embroidery, and tapestry – to the company's range of goods. All of these were sold in the shop that Morris opened on Oxford Street in 1877, in a fashionable space that offered a new kind of 'all under one roof' retail experience. By 1881 Morris had built up enough capital to acquire Merton Abbey Mills, a textile factory in south London. This allowed him to bring all the company's workshops together in one place, and to have closer control overproduction.\n\nIn his political life, Morris became increasingly disillusioned with parliamentary politics as a means of ending class division, and in 1884 he helped set up a new group called the Socialist League. He made frequent street-corner speeches and went on marches, but his fame protected him against the sanctions of a disapproving establishment. Increasingly, Morris began to leave matters at Merton Abbey in charge of his assistant Henry Dearle and other senior members of the firm, including his daughter, May. He did however continue his interest in tapestry, and for the last five years of his life was involved with Burne-Jones and Dearle on the design of a set of panels based on the [i]Search for the Holy Grail[/i].\n\nTowards the end of his career, Morris began to focus increasingly on his writing, publishing several prose narratives, including his most celebrated: [i]News from Nowhere[/i] (1890). Infused with his socialist ideas and romantic utopianism, this book offers Morris's vision of a simple world in which art or 'work-pleasure' is demanded of and enjoyed by all. In 1891 Morris set up the Kelmscott Press. The books the Press produced – eventually, a total of 66 – were printed and bound in a medieval style, with Morris designing their typefaces, initial letters, and borders. The most famous of these is an illustrated edition of the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, which was published in 1896, a few months before Morris's death.\n\nWilliam Morris was the first artist of the modern era to combine word and image in the expression of his vision. Following in the footsteps of that other great London-born radical and luminary [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-blake]William Blake[/url], Morris developed an aesthetic in which the words printed on a hanging tapestry, for example, or in a hand-printed manuscript, were as reliant on their surrounding pattern-work for meaning as the images were on the text. This notion of multi-media art practice, though realized in the context of nostalgic medievalism, pre-empted the more overtly radical art-and-language experiments of the 20th century, from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/constructivism]Constructivist[/url] book design to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/concrete-art-concretism]Concrete[/url] Poetry.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"William Morris","relatedArtists":["57726d90edc2cb3880b4a59c","57726d82edc2cb3880b486c8","57726dffedc2cb3880b55807","57726e00edc2cb3880b55bca","57726d9bedc2cb3880b4b89c","57726df2edc2cb3880b5443f","5b181c67edc2c90c8884a7a4","58ee0e01edc2c963cc63b3ef","57726dbfedc2cb3880b4f43c","57726d99edc2cb3880b4b61a","57726dffedc2cb3880b557fb","57726d87edc2cb3880b49447","57726dacedc2cb3880b4d5f2","57726d85edc2cb3880b48e32","57726e04edc2cb3880b5615b","58d9778aedc2c9999cd00d1e","57726d96edc2cb3880b4b0cc","57726dfdedc2cb3880b55469","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a59c","57726d7cedc2cb3880b47bc2"]},{"id":"5a569ccfedc2c9952c1b6768","artistName":"Linder","url":"linder","lastNameFirst":"Sterling Linder","birthDay":"/Date(-504921600000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-62135596800000)/","birthDayAsString":"1954","deathDayAsString":"","image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/00290/images/linder/thumb2-d610f2cd-931f-41a1-bf1b-054ac15d9120.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linder_Sterling","dictionaries":["57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71e8","57726a68edc2ca38801d4f61","57726a67edc2ca38801d4ec9"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"A radical feminist and a well-known figure of the Manchester punk and post-punk scene, Linder is known for her montages, which often combined images taken from pornographic magazines with images from women's fashion and domestic magazines, particularly those of domestic appliances, making a point about the cultural expectations of women and the treatment of female body as a commodity.

Eitoku (1543–1590), a grandson of Motonobu and probably his pupil, was the most important painter of this generation, and is believed to have been the first to use a gold-leaf background in large paintings. He appears to have been the main figure in developing the new castle style, but while his importance is fairly clear there are few if any certain attributions to him, especially to his hand alone; in the larger works attributed to him he probably worked together with one of more other artists of the school.","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"狩野 永徳","relatedArtists":["598ec01dedc2c929c03c1dcb","598eb8cfedc2c929c0c598c7","57726dccedc2cb3880b509eb","57726dc6edc2cb3880b50006"]},{"id":"5ab15a2eedc2c915f412edfe","artistName":"Montserrat Gudiol","url":"montserrat-gudiol","lastNameFirst":null,"birthDay":"/Date(-1153872000000)/","deathDay":"/Date(1451001600000)/","birthDayAsString":"June 9, 1933","deathDayAsString":"December 25, 2015","image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/00176/images/montserrat-gudiol/montserratgudiol016-1.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_Gudiol","dictionaries":[],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"Montserrat Gudiol born in Barcelona in 1933. She is the daughter of the architect and art historian Gudiol Ricart. In 1950, she studied restoration of old paintings and focuses specifically on painting on wood and paper. It sets out in Spain but also in South Africa, the United States, Russia and Canada. In 1981 she became the first woman admitted to the Real Academia Catalana of Fine Arts of San Jordi. In 1998 she received the Cross of St. George. \n\nThe starting point for Montserrat Gudiol’s work is founded on the broad tradition of figurative art filtered through Symbolism and a stylisation that values the detail at the core of the painting. Through the concentric blurring of the surroundings, Gudiol explores the plasticity of the expression of the faces and the spirituality that issues as much from the private and calm halo of the subjects as from the atmosphere that generates it. The tone of the painting is arrived at by means of a small range of colours – blacks and ochres – on the surface. Small reddish areas fill the wall and give it a sense of substance and volume.\n\nThe sensibility of the figures portrayed emanates from their handsome, Gothic and timeless faces, and the painted women become ethereal and symbolic. The models, who are always women and created with the contrasts inherent in human existence, strive to convey the sensitive and reflective soul that they are endowed with thanks to Gudiol’s skill. Gudiol makes the contrasting colour predominate over the drawing, in which she singles out the face rather than the body, which is merged into the backdrop done in identical colours.\n\nThe structure of Figure is asymmetric. The two sole points of light – the window and the face of the only figure in the painting – are to the spectator’s right. The tension created by this layout allows the artist to deploy an entire range of chromatic devices based on chiaroscuro. The woman’s body is shown at rest and is lightly outlined in such a way that it merges with the background, highlighting the face, the mirror of the soul. The paradox heightens the mystical component of the work: the light is generated and enters via the back, at the rear guard of the archetype, and also emphasises the lighting value of the face, the gold of the image that blends with the darkness, in the calm. The human figure as the theme from every angle, with all the expressions that shape it.","gender":"","originalArtistName":"Montserrat Gudiol Corominas","relatedArtists":[]},{"id":"59acda5aedc2c9cf6c5188b9","artistName":"Leonetto Cappiello","url":"leonetto-cappiello","lastNameFirst":"Cappiello Leonetto","birthDay":"/Date(-2990131200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-880848000000)/","birthDayAsString":"April, 1875","deathDayAsString":"February 2, 1942","image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/00290/images/leonetto-cappiello/portrait-of-leonetto-cappiello.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonetto_Cappiello","dictionaries":["57726b4dedc2cb3880ad6de0","57726a67edc2ca38801d4d41","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d8","57726b4fedc2cb3880ad71d0"],"periods":[],"series":[],"activeYearsStart":null,"activeYearsCompletion":null,"biography":"","gender":"male","originalArtistName":"","relatedArtists":["594eb10aedc2c91bc43b8a7c","57726d90edc2cb3880b4a5ee","59517d14edc2c9282859e8d3","5855b9d8edc2c96f88886827","57726d8bedc2cb3880b49c04","57726d94edc2cb3880b4ac6c","5911d2a7edc2c94250ba119d","58914110edc2c92d746a0767","5b4cdd26edc2c919c47e01f2","57726ddbedc2cb3880b52151","57726d81edc2cb3880b48539","5b181c67edc2c90c8884a7a4","59836d36edc2c9658c61e0c3","57726da8edc2cb3880b4cfc1","5abb12aeedc2c9d7d8cac49e","57726da7edc2cb3880b4ce18","57726d89edc2cb3880b49827","58e42b54edc2c99464d1f36f","57726d85edc2cb3880b48f21","57726da9edc2cb3880b4d0cd"]}]}
